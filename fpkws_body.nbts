<p>I would like to make a navbar span across 2 lines and decide which items are on each line.</p>

<p>Current items are:</p>

<p>ABOUT<br>
EDITORIAL<br>
FEATURES<br>
BODY & BATH<br>
BRANDS<br>
FRAGRANCE<br>
LIFESTYLE<br>
MAKEUP<br>
SKINCARE<br></p>

<p>I would like ABOUT - FEATURES on the top line and BODY & BATH - SKINCARE on a line below it.</p>

<p>I would also like to style the top line differently.</p>

<p>The website currently looks like this: <a href="http://www.hughes-test.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hughes-test.co.uk</a></p>

<p>If it makes it any easier to understand what I am trying to achieve here is a mock up I created: <a href="http://www.hughes-test.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Navbar-mockup.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hughes-test.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Navbar-mockup.jpg</a></p>

<p>It would be great if I had the option to align the menu to the right too.</p>

<p>I have a decent understanding of html and CSS but cannot work out how to achieve this, any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>I am using Customizr Theme set up as a child theme.</p>
 <p>I have had my leo since february. His name is Elvis (i think its a male) the last two weeks he has been very lethargic and slowly not eating, and now more recently hes not pooping. it started when he was having trouble shedding. i waited a few days before i helped him. i had to soak him in warm water and use a q-tip. i have entirely cleaned out his cage, fresh crickets and mealworms. but still nothing. as of right now he hasnt pooped in about 4+ days. he barely moves, and when he does its slowly, he doesnt even do much when i open his cage and touch him.  he is starting to lose weight and i am very worried about him.</p>
 <p>I want to be able to stream any movie or TV show on the raspberry pi much like you can do on sites like watchseries and putlocker.</p>

<p>What's the best solution for this with minimum lag and high quality streaming?</p>
 <p>I have some questions regarding the use of coxph() and predict(Surv()). I am aware that my question is a bit long one and maybe I have not explained myself well enough but any comment or suggestion is appreciated. </p>

<p>I am trying to make a Cox PH model and predictions for roof repair on houses. I have 5 input variables (covariates):</p>

<p>House_Age (also called Start), House_Price, Roof_Material_Grp_New, Land_Ownership_Status_Grp, Living_Status_Grp</p>

<p>As the names suggest the first two are numeric variables and the last three at categorical. My problem is that I want to make the House_Age hazard to be depending on time. I chose to do 'datasplitting' for every third year of House_Age (so House_Age turns into the variable Start) - for instance in the case of an Event happening after 7 years the data would look like</p>

<pre><code>Start Stop Event_01_Ts

0    3           0 (Censored)
3    3           0 (Censored)
6    1           1 (Event)
</code></pre>

<p>Start is equal to the House_Age. As I could see on the estimates of each value of Start group there seemed to a linear dependence until about 40 years so I chose to have a maximum Start/House_Age of 40 and a linear relation</p>

<pre><code>Cox_Mod_Lin <- coxph(Surv(Stop,Event_01_Ts) ~ Start+Roof_Material_Grp_New+House_Contract_Yen+Land_Ownership_Status_Grp+Living_Status_Grp,data=Abt_Roof_Ts_Mdl)
</code></pre>

<p>The model comes out fine with linear coefficient on the Start variable on 0.1916 and an exponential value of 1.211
                                  coef  exp(coef)   se(coef)       z Pr(>|z|)<br>
Start                        1.916e-01  1.211e+00  6.817e-03  28.112  < 2e-16 ***</p>

<p>Looking on the Start/House_Age isolated, the hazard increases by 21% each year - is the correct? My problem is that now I want to make predicitons of 'repair' probabilities whitin 1, 5 and 10 years for instance. First I try to find the baseline hazard function by using survfit and a zero-vector as input</p>

<pre><code>Base <- survfit(Cox_Mod_Lin,Abt_Baseline,type='aalen')
Base_Time_Hz <- as.data.frame(cbind(Base$time,Base$cumhaz))
Base_Time_Hz_1yr <- Base_Time_Hz[which(Base_Time_Hz$Time==1),]
</code></pre>

<p>Here Abt_Baseline contains zeroes for numerical variables and zero-level group values for groups. From this I find the cumulative hazard for time=1, 5 and 10 (only 1 year is shown) and multiply this with the exponential of the "lp" prediction found by using the predict function.</p>

<p>One year prediction:</p>

<pre><code>Pred_01<-Base_Time_Hz_1yr$Cumhaz*exp(predict(Cox_Mod_Lin,Abt_Roof_Score, type="lp"))
</code></pre>

<p>This would be OK if there were no time dependent inputs but the hazard varies in the future as a function of the Start (=House_Age) variable. I know the future values of the Start (increase by 1 each year) so I suppose that I could integrate somehow over the prediction period. So I have two main questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this seem to be a sensible way for doing the modeling and (some of) the prediction?</li>
<li>If yes - how do I do the integration over the prediction period with with respect to the varying (increasing) House_Age/Start hazard? </li>
</ul>

<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

 <p>I am new to the concept of Normalization. I have a dataset that has normalized values in it.</p>

<p>But I need the de-normalized values. (actual values)</p>

<p>Is there any way I can get it?</p>

<p>Details about the dataset - the dataset has been taken from the package 'FWDSelect' in R.</p>

<p>diabetes is a data frame with 11 variables (columns). The first column of the data frame contains the response variable (diabetes$y) which is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. The rest of the columns contain the measurements of the ten explanatory variables (age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure and six blood serum registers) obtained from each of the 442 diabetes patients.</p>

<p>The data has been standardized to have unit L2 norm in each column and zero mean.</p>

<p>Thanks!

 <p>I watched this video: <a href="http://www.physics-astronomy.com/2015/09/here-is-what-emc2-truly-means.html#.V4OxnRJywqK" rel="nofollow">http://www.physics-astronomy.com/2015/09/here-is-what-emc2-truly-means.html#.V4OxnRJywqK</a>
At one point, the man explains how a flashlight loses some mass due to light emission when turned on. OK, I get that. Then he talks about a different situation, where the flashlight is inside a mirror box. I understand that this is a closed system, no light gets out, so there is no change in mass of the system. </p>

<p>But there is one thing that I don't get. Suppose you put the mirror box with the flashlight on scales. In that case, after turning the flashlight on, the scales don't move. In the case of flashlight without the box, the scales move a little due to the loss of mass. So far so good. Now, suppose you have the mirror box on the scales and break one wall. It is no longer a closed system, light is emitted and the scales should move. BUT, how do the scales know what I consider to be a closed system? Do they move at a time the light leaves the box through the crack in the wall? What if the box were just larger, would the weight loss happen later? Or, if I had a box full of cracks and sent a beam of light through it, would the scales indicate weight increase at a time the light enters the box? This seems totally wrong, but I can't see a difference, from the point of view of the scales, between a cracked box with beam of light going through it and a sealed box with a beam of light moving inside. I just can't get my head around how do the scales know what to weigh...</p>

 <p>There's a movie (or tv drama) about a fat family moving to a place where everyone there are concerned about how slim they look. In the school, students need to ride a bike while having class. The family own a restaurant, but no one eat there because they are selling food high in fat. In order to fit, they sell light meal to attract customers. The Mum tries to lose weight to wear those small size clothes. The little fat boy falls in love with a girl in his class, the girl's mum is really concered about weight and a perfect body. Anyone watched this before? As long as a remember, it's a french movie (or tv series). I haven't finished the whole movie yet, please help if you know the name. Thank you so much!</p>
 <p>I am not getting the right type of unsalted butter. Can I use Nutralite salted butter in my cakes?</p>
 <p>I have a school project in java in which i want to calculate the weight loss per month if I can say my inputs like how many calories I have burnt, what is my current weight, how many hours I'm working in gym. I have done the basic coding but I'm unable to get the output </p>

<p>My problem is explained in detail in this link kindly help me </p>

<p>This is an android app I'm developing.</p>

 <p>Hello I am a student wanting to do a statistics test to compare the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>REE (initial) vs %EWL after one year.</p></li>
<li><p>REE (initial) vs weight loss after one year.</p></li>
<li><p>Change in REE (initial to one year) and %EWL after one year.</p></li>
<li><p>Type of weight loss surgery (I have two different types) and %EWL </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm unsure if I do a simple correlation coefficient, a MANOVA, or a Mann-Whitney?</p>

<p>And would figures be possible, and if so for which?</p>
 <p>I don't understand why, if a penis can be reconstructed from a clitoris for sex change, surgical penis enlargement is not possible.</p>

 <p>I'm designing a MySQL database and the front end for my work. The database will store all of the products that we sell on our marketplaces and their relevant data. We will be able to lookup products and see their calculated cost for our different marketplaces. I plan on expanding the functionality in the future but for the moment our goal is just product pricing and dimensional data lookup.</p>

<p>How does this design diagram look to you guys? Is there anything that you would recommend me to add or change? I am open to criticism as this is my first professional database project.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

 <p>I'm looking to build a database of the ingredients listed on the labels of top selling skincare products and use it to determine which products are the most similar to each other. </p>

<p>Ideally this would run on a website, where someone could search for the product, select it, and the page would serve up a list of products that contain the most similar ingredients. </p>

<p>Legally ingredients must be listed in order of prominence, with the most prominent listed first and descending from there. </p>

<p>I'd like to be able to compare the order of ingredients and have say, the first 5 ingredients weighed more heavily in determining similarity of formula. Then perhaps the other ingredients can be used as a sort of tie breaker.</p>
 <p>I've got a table of data. 
Person   Diagnosis   Date entered  Date of birth  Unique ID
John S   Measles     07/04/16       07 09 10      aaaa
John S   Mumps       08/06/12       07 09 10      aaaa 
John S   Herpes      08/07/16       07 09 98      bbbb</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is:</p>

<p>IF Person, Date of Birth, Unique ID all Match 
Then create a table like</p>

<pre><code>                 Diagnosis1 Diagnosis2 Diagnosis3 etc
</code></pre>

<p>Person DOB     UNID
  John S 07 09 10 aaaa  Mumps      Measles</p>

<p>When I try to create a duplicate query I can match all three IDs, but I can only return First and Last Diagnosis. There are some people in my table with more than one Diagnosis. I'd like to arrange the table so the name is a row header, and all the various associated diagnoses are arranged as above. </p>

<p>In the table of data I have a person can be in with one episode, more than one episode of different infections, or more than one episode of the same infection. Using the date that infection was entered would help identify whether there has been a duplication (which can happen). </p>

<p>How can I go about generating the table in the way i want so that i can:
1) identify any potential name/dob/uid matches
2) see their diagnosis history laid out as above</p>

 <p>Ok so I buy and sell gold and I'm trying to figure out how big of a percent my buyer takes when he pays me. I sent in
3.28 Troy oz. 
the weight after melt comes down to 3.17 Troy oz. 
48.3% of the total weight is pure gold so he is able to buy 1.531 Troy oz of pure gold. 
 Supposedly he pays 95% of the pure gold contained. 
So far I know I lose 5% of the golds value. 
But is that all I lose? 
I figured with my calculations he all together takes 8.35% including weight loss. 
Are my mathematics correct?</p>

 <p>I would like to know how to read information from an excel file (saved as .csv) for then printing it into another file, using C++.
The input file has the data separated into columns. The first line of each column is the label of the column. Such as this:</p>

<pre><code>|Column1|Column2|Column3|Column4|Column5|Column6
|char1.1|char2.1|       |       |       |char6.1
|char1.2|char2.2|int3.2 |char4.2|bool5.2|char6.2
|char1.3|char2.3|int3.3 |char4.3|bool5.3|char6.3
|char1.4|char2.4|       |       |       |char6.4
|char1.5|char2.5|       |       |       |char6.5
|char1.6|char2.6|int3.6 |char4.6|bool5.6|char6.6
</code></pre>

<p>So from this table, I would like to extract the columns 3, 4 and 5 (only when there is information, so lines 2,3 and 6) and print the information 
into another csv file, such as this:</p>

<pre><code>|Column3|Column4|Column5|
|int3.2 |char4.2|bool5.2|
|int3.3 |char4.3|bool5.3|
|int3.6 |char4.6|bool5.6|
</code></pre>

<p>I've been looking in the internet, but since I have little experience in programming, I couldn' figure it out.
If you have any idea from where I could start or if you know any web or tutorial specialised in dealing with csv files it would help me a lot.</p>
 <p>I am trying to run a linear model on a variable that seems to follow a lognormal distribution. Many specialists recommend to use a GLM with a log link function instead of using a standard linear model on the log transformed variable. </p>

<p>However, if I'm not mistaken, for a GLM, we should not look at the univariate distribution of the response to assess the distributional shape, since it depends on the pattern of the x's.
Consequently my question is simple :</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I look at the distributional shape of my response variable y according to the x's ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanking you in advance.</p>

<p>Best regards.</p>
 <p>I wonder if you can help me on this,</p>

<p>I am a  2nd year EEE specialising in embedded systems. I am interested in setting up a start up in a fitness device capable of tracking person fitness and deliver personalised feedback and targets using internet of things and API. </p>

<p>At the moment I am in research stage - I am wondering whether anyone could advise on what skilled resources are needed to put this together such as hardware engineers/training etc… </p>

<p>I have come up with only the physical resources needed (which I have uploaded below ) but not skilled resources (ie skilled workers). I am new to the IoT field. Can anyone please advise on me on the resources and also please suggest how I can get more useful information about starting B2B startup in the internet of things market. resources</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>
 <p>My hard disk drive is always busy, even in SAFE Mode with or without networking. In Normal Windows, the computer will occasionally freeze with a black screen and the computer needs to be turned off in order to get it to work again.</p>

<p>I have McAfee Antivirus protection always turned on but have turned it off to see if this might be the culprit. No effect by turning it off.</p>

<p>The task manager shows 99% idle time yet the hard drive is very busy.</p>

<p>I have run the following software programs with no avail:
1. McAfee Scan
2. Spybot S&D
3. Little Registry Cleaner
4. Spyhunter
5. Reghunter</p>

<p>Sometimes I get the impression that (someone - or some software) is collecting all my computer information. This is just a gut feeling and I have no proof. Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing the problem?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
 <p>I'm trying to redirect all http requests to https and www to non-www URLs.</p>

<p>Egs:</p>

<pre><code>1) http://abc.in to https://abc.in
2) http://www.abc.in to https://abc.in
3) http://www.abc.in to https://abc.in
4) https://www.abc.in to https://abc.in
</code></pre>

<p>I was successfully able to redirect URL conditions (1, 2 & 3) but the 4rd redirect condition does not work i.e. <a href="https://www.abc.in" rel="nofollow">https://www.abc.in</a> to <a href="https://abc.in" rel="nofollow">https://abc.in</a></p>

<p>I have an SSL certificate for both www and non-www URLs for my website. I'm currently using WordPress.</p>

<p>My .htaccess file contains the following code:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(?:www\.)?(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule (.*) https://%1%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried many different redirect conditions but none worked.</p>

<p>I get the following error in Firefox: An error occurred during a connection to www.penisenhancement.in. Peer reports it experienced an internal error. Error code: SSL_ERROR_INTERNAL_ERROR_ALERT</p>

<p>What can I do to redirect the 4th URL condition?</p>
 <p>I am trying to create a new Data layer which outputs two data blobs and one label blob. For example, as in this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6387" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6387</a> , where you need raw image patches as well as pairwise information among them to be fed into the CRF Loss layer. I have implemented the data layer which takes images and computed the patches and pairwise information among them and creates two top data blobs and one top label blob. While running, the layers are setup correctly with proper shapes but I get the following error in the unary network, just after pool5 and before fc6.</p>

<p>Can someone help me understand where am I going wrong?</p>

 <p>CODE keyboards are, indeed, some of the best I've found.</p>

<p>I run the <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-104-key-mechanical-keyboard-777.html">CODE 104 MX Blue</a>, and I've loved it.</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't slip (rubberized feet, and good weight).</li>
<li>$145 (incidentally, all the CODE keyboards are well within your budget)</li>
<li>Nice and clicky like a mechanical should be - but the "hail on a tin roof" is dampened so you don't get constant rattling (use MX Brown caps if you want completely dampened clicks)</li>
<li>There's a <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-87-key-mechanical-keyboard-475.html">version of it without a numpad</a></li>
<li>It <em>does</em> have the Windows key not a command key - but you can disable the Windows logo key or swap it to function as a command key</li>
<li>Backlit (adjustable and toggleable)</li>
<li>You can toggle between QWERTY, Dvorak, and a couple of other layouts</li>
</ul>

<p>I use it with a Windows laptop, so I can't guarantee it works on a Mac - but I'd imagine it does. Also, it comes by default as wired USB - this is convertible to a PS/2 connection, but I don't believe it's Bluetooth-enabled.</p> <p>CODE keyboards are, indeed, some of the best I've found.</p>

Also, it comes by default as wired USB - this is convertible to a PS/2 connection, but I don't believe it's Bluetooth-enabled.</p> <p>I have a table that holds a user's weight for specific days. In my <code>weights_controller.rb</code> index action I can show these weights - no problem. What I also want to show on the index is the user's current weight, his weight loss over time as well as the timeframe he achieved this weight loss.</p>

<p>Thus I created a <strong>weight_calculator.rb</strong> to do the needed calculations:</p>

<pre><code>class WeightCalculator
  def initialize(profile, user)
     @profile = profile
     @user = user
  end

  def current_weight
    @current_weight = Weight.where(:user_id => @user.id).order(:day).last
  end

  def weight_loss
    @current_weight = Weight.where(:user_id => @user.id).order(:day).last
    @start_weight = Weight.where(:user_id => @user.id).order(:day).first
    @weight_loss = @current_weight.kilograms - @start_weight.kilograms
  end

  def timeframe
    @current_weight = Weight.where(:user_id => @user.id).order(:day).last
    @start_weight = Weight.where(:user_id => @user.id).order(:day).first
    @weight_loss_timeframe = @current_weight.day - @start_weight.day
    @weeks = @weight_loss_timeframe.to_i/7
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is my <strong>weights_controller.rb</strong> index action:</p>

<pre><code>  def index
    @weights = Weight.where(:user_id => current_user.id).order(day: :desc)
    @weight_loss = WeightCalculator.new(@profile, current_user).weight_loss
    @weeks = WeightCalculator.new(@profile, current_user).timeframe

    @result = {}
    Weight.where(:user_id => current_user.id).each do |weight|
      @result[weight.day] = weight.kilograms
    end

    @profile = Profile.where(:user_id => current_user.id)
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works fine in this setup. However, there is clearly some repition in my <code>weight_calculator.rb</code> and I am asking myself what would be the best way to write this code to be DRY conform?</p>

<p>Thanks for help.</p>
 <p>Car trouble.  I suspect the fuel injector circuit.  I am trying to construct a com port reader that will place a timestamp into a log on the closing the 12v fuel injector circuit. </p>

<p>The fuel injector is a simple normally open 12v circuit of 2 wires.  The + is tied into the ignition switch.  The ground is held open by the ECM (Electronic Control Module). When it is time to squirt fuel into the cylinder, the ECM pulses/flashes the ground to complete the circuit.</p>

<p>I am planning on using Eltima's Serial Port Monitor to record the event of the closed circuit with a timestamp on a single injector and store the data into a log so that I can evaluate and analyze the data.</p>

<p>Originally, I thought I would simply run pin 3 of a DB9 to a back probe on the injector and run the engine.  But with the circuit always powered by 12 volts, I would get a reading on pin 3 coinciding with the ignition switch and not with the pulsing ground.  </p>

<p>Do you have any ideas on how to read the pulsing ground on the fuel injector?</p>
 <p>We have a honey locust that developed a disease within is first year and an arborist saw it.  He told me it is what they call herpes for trees.  It had cankers of some sort on the trunk that had killed the majority of the tree.  He said we could cut the main trunk off and create a new main trunk with a zip tie, the nearest large branch, and patience.  After 7 years, it has flourished, somewhat.   The trunk has grown around the dead part and it appears sturdy.  However...I'm afraid too much of the inner trunk is dead wood and will not provide a sturdy enough trunk as the tree continues to mature.  No branches really grow on the affected side of the tree either.  How can I upload photos?  Do we bite the bullet and remove the tree now or will it be okay in the years to come?  We love our little std tree...</p>

 <p>I only have a copy of my passport and visa because my original passport is stuck in the Canadian visa centre in NY since I requested a travel visa to visit Canada. I was supposed to receive back my passport days ago, but the service takes more than it usually does. It won't be delivered to me in time for my flight to Miami. The other documents I have are my own country's ID and an international drivers licence. Is there any way I can still fly? 
Thank you in advance for your attention and help. </p>

 <p>Example:-domain/course.php?online-corporate-training-hyderabad-india-uk-usa=1</p>

<p>I dont want an id. I just need whatever the course name that I enter should display over there instead of
 id. </p>

<p>Like this type:-domain/course.php?online-corporate-training-hyderabad-india-uk-usa=PHP</p>
 <p>My app is a weight loss app. It uses Devise for user authentication. A user <code>has_one :profile</code> (the profile table holds the <code>user_id</code> as foreign key) that stores data like prename, surname etc. and which is created automatically when a user signs up. A profile <code>has_many :weights</code> (users of the app should weigh themselves regularly and store their new weight in this table). So far so good. </p>

<p>I have the following problem:
If a logged in user goes to the index page of the weight controller he sees only his own weights. However, if this user now changes the profile_id in the URL bar he can also see the weights of that other profile (although it is not "his" profile). Additionally, he can now create a new weight, which then holds the other profile_id (which is obviously not his own).</p>

<p>What I managed to do is to generally restrict users to edit or destroy weights which do not hold their own profile_id (through <code>before_action :require_same_weight_profile</code> in my weights_controller.rb).</p>

<p>My question now: how can I prevent this user (that has a certain profile) to do the stuff described above?</p>

<p>I'm sure the answer is pretty simple (I started coding just a few months ago).</p>

<p>Thanks for help!</p>

 <p>I have created a database with the intention of allowing analysis of patients blood test results for a certain condition. The query itself is working fine however is unsearchable (in other queries i've generated I've identified this is was because I had spaces in the headings and so removed these)
This query is now duplicating patients for each positive test they have from the selection. This seems to be linked to the .value column as goes away when this is removed however then the query becomes unsearchable using the quick search tool.</p>

<p>Is there any solution to this? I'm using the query wizard to build these. Believe the problem is with the 'OtherImmunology.Value' part</p>

<p>SELECT [Clinical Contact Information].RQ6Number, [Patient Information].FirstName, [Patient Information].LastName, [Patient Information].NHSNumber, [Patient Information].DoB, DateDiff("yyyy",[DoB],[InitialDiagnosisDate]) AS AgeAtDiagnosis, [Patient Information].Gender, [Patient Information].[Diagnosis(IAPConsensusCriteria)], [Clinical Contact Information].InitialDiagnosisDate, [Clinical Contact Information].SteroidTherapy, [Clinical Contact Information].ResponsetoSteroids, [Clinical Contact Information].IgG4Level, [Clinical Contact Information].[IgG4ActualResult(mg/dL)], [Clinical Contact Information].SerumIgG, [Clinical Contact Information].[SerumIgG Result(g/L)], [Clinical Contact Information].OtherImmunologyTested, [Clinical Contact Information].OtherImmunology, [Clinical Contact Information].<strong>OtherImmunology.Value, [Clinical Contact Information]</strong>.[Ca19-9Level], [Clinical Contact Information].[Ca19-9ActualResult(kU/L)], [Clinical Contact Information].Surgery, [Clinical Contact Information].OtherAutoimmuneConditions, [Clinical Contact Information].AutoimmuneCondition, [Clinical Contact Information].Completed

 <p>I'm going to write an app for periodically dumping our company Instagram account information to DB (posts/likes/comments) for further analytics. Will it pass review or they will decline this as "one-off project"?</p>
 <p>And I'm looking for a word that comes from the old germanic language. Not just the word "Penis" since that is a word derives from Latin.</p>
 <p>My api's are working well with mySql but when I change into MSSQL I got an error.
Actually I already get all the data from MSSQL, but my other api's didnt work.
Here's my working code for get all datas:</p>

<pre><code>$app->get('/mirror', 'getAll'); 
$app->get('/mirror/{skincare_process_info_id}', function($request,$response,$args){
    get_skin_id($args['skincare_process_info_id']);
}); 
$app->run();

function getAll() {
    $sql = "select * FROM SkincareProcessInfo ORDER BY skincare_process_info_id";
    try {
        $db = connect_db();
        $stmt   = $db->query($sql);
        $skin  = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
        $db = null;
        echo '{"skin process info": ' . json_encode($skin) . '}';
    }catch(PDOException $e) {
        echo '{"error":{"text":'. $e->getMessage() .'}}';
    }    
} 
</code></pre>

<p>it works fine, but in my other api's:
here's my api for get data by id:</p>

<pre><code>    function get_skin_id($skin_id){

    $sql = "SELECT * FROM SkincareProcessInfo WHERE `skincare_process_info_id` = '$skin_id'";

     try{ 
        $db = connect_db();
        $stmt = $db->query($sql);
        $skin = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        $db = null; 
         if($stmt == 1){
            echo '{"skin process info": ' . json_encode($skin) . '}';
        }else{
            echo 'false';
        } 

    }catch(PDOException $e){
        echo '{"error":{"text":'. $e->getMessage() .'}}';
    } 
}

 <p>Hoping someone can help us sort out this issue. It's clear that we had about 1000 visits to a post today that contains an embedded youtube video. Visitors spent an average of 3:35 minutes on the page, which has got to mean that most people watched the video, since the video is 4 minutes long: or, at least the majority of visitors must have watched enough of the video to count as a view. However, the video has only 375 views according to youtube.</p>

<p>The video is just regularly embedded on wordpress. There's a bit of intro text, but that's it (so no other reason to stay on the post for 3+ minutes if not for watching the video). So.... what's going on here!? Why is the view count so low?</p>

<p>My only thought is that maybe on certain devices the video autoplays or something like that, that might negate a view count? Anyway, if anyone has ideas please share! Thanks.</p>

<p>Here are the related link, and a screenshot of visits vs. view count.</p>

 <p>This is a story from <em>Analog</em> Magazine about the 1990s.</p>

<p>An English professor made his reputation critiquing the stories of a dead writer, especially one particular one.  The story opened in class when a student pointed out that the entire meaning of the story would be different if the first letter of a particular word was different, and wondered if that was the case.  The professor said he was wrong, but wondered.</p>

<p>After obsessive research, he still couldn't tell the first letter of that word, since the original manuscript had both letters superimposed in that space, and he couldn't tell which had been typed first.  His friend in the physics department told him they had just invented a method of communicating with people in the past.</p>

<p>He communicated with the writer, who was upset that her early death from a heart attack meant she would never enjoy her fame, and she was angry that he cared more about understanding her story than warning her to avoid death.  She didn't tell him, and she was careful to type both letters in the manuscript so no one (not even we the readers) would ever know.</p>

<p>And then she began exercising and dieting to loose weight and try to avoid her heart attack and enjoy wealth and fame.  But unfortunately she overdid it and caused the heart attack she was trying to avoid.</p>

<p>So does anyone remember the title, author, and issue?</p>

 <p>First, if you are thinking that this question is a joke or troll, I'd like to welcome you to the 21st century when the mankind is discussing legality of gay marriages.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at the sexuality (I'll keep it clean) of all the Avengers minus Captain America:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Iron Man: Well, he is a billionaire playboy who can bring hot female journalists to bed with a snap of a finger (<em>Iron Man</em> movie). Otherwise, he has a girlfriend who is CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.</p></li>
<li><p>Thor: He has a noble prize winner girlfriend who doesn't belong to his species.</p></li>
<li><p>Hulk: Dr. Banner had a girlfriend, but then the gamma accident happened which could turn him into a green monster upon arousal (<em>The Incredible Hulk</em> movie). It's still unclear whether he can now have sex or not (after he controlled himself with meditation) and his girlfriend is still with him or not, but he isn't a virgin and nobody knows what happened after <em>Age of Ultron</em>. It's possible that Black Widow successfully seduced him after he was found again.</p></li>
<li><p>Black Widow: Although, she is single and she has been sterilized, it's difficult to believe that she is a virgin and she doesn't have sex regularly because she is seen kissing around. And, she was trying to seduce Dr. Banner (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> movie). The point is: She is sexually active.</p></li>
<li><p>Hawkeye: He is married (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> movie).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, look at Captain America:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When Peggy kissed him in <em>Captain America</em> movie, it was their first kiss and then he got iced.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast forward to 21st century: Although his age is 80+, he is still young. Yet, he doesn't have a girlfriend and he doesn't show any interest in girls. Even when Black Widow kissed him, he didn't try to drag her to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about low libido (a medical condition which arises due to stress and other factors), it's impossible because his super soldier serum should keep him healthy in all way. From the functional biology point of view, low libido is actually caused by imbalance of hormones. Stress suppresses rest-and-digest autonomous nervous system and activates fight-or-flight autonomous nervous system (that's why stress, depression etc damage health). In case of Captain America, yes, he got negative emotions after he was defrosted, but his super soldier serum should take care of his biological health. So, one of the other possibilities: He is gay (which has been proved to be a natural condition, not some kind of abnormality).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To prove that he is gay, let's look at his emotional responses: In 21st century, when he met Peggy, he didn't become emotional. But, when he saw Bucky, he became emotional.</p>

<p>I am a straight male and I am creative enough to emulate the situation well. If I had met my first love in such situation, I would have become emotional and it'd actually hurt to know that she is old and I am young. Talking about a dead best friend who is somehow alive and attacking me, my natural response would start with a slang. By no means, Captain America's emotional response looks straight man's response and it looks a gay's response.</p>

<p>Is Captain America really gay? Am I overthinking or producers are really hinting something to throw later? These days it's common in media for awareness. For example, Flash (2014) TV show has a gay police officer.</p>

<p>A more general question: Has sexual orientation of Captain America been disclosed? If he isn't gay, is he straight (there are lots of sexual orientations e.g. Bisexuality)? What about comics?</p>
 <p>My goal is to have a floating button on top of homescreen (or other apps) and take a screen shot when it's clicked and have that picture sent to my app.

<p>Is it possible to make an widget-like button, that runs on top of another app, through unity? (I was able to do it in Android Studio)</p>

<p>Is it possible to take screen-shot of other apps or home screen?</p>
 <p>I have the following sheet setup</p>

<pre><code>Column A - Brand Names
Column B - Product Names
</code></pre>

<p>The product names are structured as:</p>

<pre><code>Nike Air Force White
Addidas Trainers Black
</code></pre>

<p>I want to remove the brand name from the start of each product name. Therefore I think I need to create a formula to use the brand name from Column A and delete that from Column B.</p>

<p>Your help would me really appreciated if a formula could be provided for this.</p>

 <p>As by <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/information/anatomy/shed-skin-cells.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> a normal human being looses about 3.6 kilograms (8 pounds) of skin cells every year. They are usually eaten by dust mites.</p>

<p>But certainly this does not apply to  Kryptonian skin cells as they would resist any dust mites' approach to eat them. So I was wondering where do they go? Will they ever vanish?</p>
 <p>I am asking this behalf of my friend. He was gonna commit suicide. But I managed to calm him down by taking him to a buddhist temple. He had a really fun life, movies, friends, night outs, girls, cars, everything. But suddenly he got to know that he has a skin condition called herpes. Something like a pimple. But it seems he regret a lot a lot as it has no cure. But it is a very common all over the world. He don't understand and tried to suicide. He has given up life. Luckily I brought him to this buddhist temple and managed to save his life. Now he is very interest in becoming a theravada monk and spend the life in a temple meditating, learning and practising buddhism. I decided to support him as he was a good person, help others, donate etc. I am wondering if his conditions and previous life style matters to become a monk. Thanks.</p>
 <p>I just watched Captain America: Civil War and their was something that didn't make sense. In Captain America: The First Avenger we find out that Abraham Erskine created the Super Solider Serum and even he didn't get it right the first time. The last vial was destroyed during the Hydra agent's escape and it was said that the formula died with him. In Agent Carter we found out that Howard hid a vial of Steve's blood with him which Peggy eventually destroyed. In the Incredible Hulk we found out that even Bruce Banner failed to replicate the process. In Civil War we find out that Howard Stark was traveling with a certain serum that Bucky stole for the Russians. Did Howard manage to replicate Erskine's formula and did it work for the Russians besides the preliminary testing?</p>
 <p>The four-course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_radio_range" rel="nofollow">Low Frequency Radio Range</a> system used for aircraft navigation (in the US and elsewhere) in the 1930s and 1940s used a pair of directional antenna (with figure-of-8 shaped radiation patterns) at 90 degrees to each other.  One antenna would transmit the Morse code pattern for "A" (⋅-) and the other for "N" (-⋅), as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jYRvvhPfmxY/VZw-MKEadeI/AAAAAAAABkc/R0CdyXh6isI/s1600/4course_diagram.gif" alt="four-course radio range"></p>

<p>When the aircraft was on course, the signals from the "A" transmitter and the "N" transmitter would be at equal value and overlap to form a continuous tone:</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.static.ovimg.com/m/06zr0d6/?width=150" alt="A+N"></p>

<p>If the antenna patterns are at 90° and the transmitted power is the same for the two signals then the system provides four different courses that a plane could fly (or eight, counting reciprocal courses away from the station).</p>

<p>Examining charts for actual installations, however, one often sees that the four courses are not at 90° angles:</p>

<p><img src="https://i596.photobucket.com/albums/tt42/ChrisHPhoto/STOUT_FLD_Inst_app_1949_p1.jpg" alt="Stout field instrument approach"></p>

<p>How was this in practice achieved?  I can see that by increasing the relative strength of one transmitter compared to the other the courses could be adjusted so they crossed at other than a right angle (like this, for the top diagram, supposing A is stronger than N):</p>

<pre><code>\ N /
 \ /
A X A
 / \
/ N \
</code></pre>

<p>But how would it be arranged to have asymmetrical patterns such as the one in the Stout Field diagram above, where the opposing courses are not at 180° angles to each other?</p>

 <p>Looking for some help in filling in time slots for epg being created from an xml file. 
This is what I am doing. I have an xml file I have created thru combing multiple xml file created for each channel I have. I have created an array ($result) as shown below.  The structure of the $result array is as follows:</p>

<pre><code><start value=>
    <programme>
        <stop></stop>
        <id></id>
        <title></title>
        <description></description>
    </programme>
</start>
</code></pre>

<p>The start value is the start YYYYMMDDHHSS show begins, stop of course is the end time. Id represent channel id,title is show name and description of course describes the show.
I have an array called $rolist that has all my channels along with channel specific info like channel id, name, url location and icon location.
Steps:
1. Loop thru $result getting the start value and comparing it to current time. If match assign to array ($guide).
2. If time matching loop thru 'programme' part of $result to check channel id against $rolist array 'gid'.
3. If id matches, assign time, title, etc to array ($guide).
4. Ok, here is my problem area, if the id doesn't match for a particular channel, I want to add the channel to the array so when the guide loads I have no blank spaces. If the id matches I get an array like the following. Under each start will be list of all channels with corresponding show title for that time slot. I want to make sure I have an entry for all channels not just ones that have matching ids. If the ids don't match that means that channel has a show that is in progress and started prior to the time slot. I need to go back on that channel id and find the most recent time that a title exist.  I have tried multiple ways but have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>When I use the code, I get a start timeslot with each channel and info under it unless a particular channel has nothing for that time, then it is left out. To test things after the else I pasted the same code I am using for the $guide but in the 'title' and 'desc' I have it write "TEST". So this way I have an entry for all channels for all times. Just need help in filling in this area with show already in progress or most recent for the channel.
Thanks for any help</p>
 <p>First, if you are thinking that this question is a joke or troll, I'd like to welcome you to the 21st century when the mankind is discussing legality of gay marriages.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at the sexuality (I'll keep it clean) of all the Avengers minus Captain America:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Iron Man: Well, he is a billionaire playboy who can bring hot female journalists to bed with a snap of a finger (<em>Iron Man</em> movie). Otherwise, he has a girlfriend who is CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.</p></li>
<li><p>Thor: He has a noble prize winner girlfriend who doesn't belong to his species.</p></li>
<li><p>Hulk: Dr. Banner had a girlfriend, but then the gamma accident happened which could turn him into a green monster upon arousal (<em>The Incredible Hulk</em> movie). It's still unclear whether he can now have sex or not (after he controlled himself with meditation) and his girlfriend is still with him or not, but he isn't a virgin and nobody knows what happened after <em>Age of Ultron</em>. It's possible that Black Widow successfully seduced him after he was found again.</p></li>
<li><p>Black Widow: Although, she is single and she has been sterilized, it's difficult to believe that she is a virgin and she doesn't have sex regularly because she is seen kissing around. And, she was trying to seduce Dr. Banner (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> movie). The point is: She is sexually active.</p></li>
<li><p>Hawkeye: He is married (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> movie).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, look at Captain America:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When Peggy kissed him in <em>Captain America</em> movie, it was their first kiss and then he got iced.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast forward to 21st century: Although his age is 80+, he is still young. Yet, he doesn't have a girlfriend and he doesn't show any interest in girls. Even when Black Widow kissed him, he didn't try to drag her to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about low libido (a medical condition which arises due to stress and other factors), it's impossible because his super soldier serum should keep him healthy in all way. From the functional biology point of view, low libido is actually caused by imbalance of hormones. Stress suppresses rest-and-digest autonomous nervous system and activates fight-or-flight autonomous nervous system (that's why stress, depression etc damage health). In case of Captain America, yes, he got negative emotions after he was defrosted, but his super soldier serum should take care of his biological health. So, one of the other possibilities: He is gay (which has been proved to be a natural condition, not some kind of abnormality).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To prove that he is gay, let's look at his emotional responses: In 21st century, when he met Peggy, he didn't become emotional. But, when he saw Bucky, he became emotional.</p>

<p>I am a straight male and I am creative enough to emulate the situation well. If I had met my first love in such situation, I would have become emotional and it'd actually hurt to know that she is old and I am young. Talking about a dead best friend who is somehow alive and attacking me, my natural response would start with a slang. By no means, Captain America's emotional response looks straight man's response and it looks a gay's response.</p>

<p>Is Captain America really gay? Am I overthinking or producers are really hinting something to throw later? These days it's common in media for awareness. For example, Flash (2014) TV show has a gay police officer.</p>

<p>A more general question: Has sexual orientation of Captain America been disclosed? If he isn't gay, is he straight (there are lots of sexual orientations e.g. Bisexuality)? What about comics?</p>
 <p>I'm a 57 yr old EE, but never had any mechanical physics classes.</p>

<p>If we have a vertically oriented disc, affixed to an axle in bearings, 1m in diameter, with two 1kg weights attached at the outermost edges (directly opposite each other), rotating at 30 RPM, how do I calculate the torque required to turn the disc?</p>

<p>I know the one rising will have a higher effective weight, due to moving against gravity, and the one "falling" will have an equal weight loss... but I'm at a loss myself as to how to solve this.</p>

<p>I want to know how to solve it, not just the answer.</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>
 <p>Yesterday I went to the cinema and watched Captain America: Civil War, the movie was great IMO, I have no big complaints. Altho one of the things that bugged me is how come the winter soldier didn't break any of his non enhanced parts of the body since he is only shown to have a superhuman arm, also when iron man gets angry in the end of the movie and destroys his enhanced arm he can't do almost anything anymore. There was no on screen enhancement with a serum as far as I remember in any of the movies. I understand that he is a trained soldier, perhaps the best one in the world(if you don't count cap) but still if he gets knocked into a wall it shouldn't be so easy to recover from. So if he gets punched by iron man(when he stopped holding back) anywhere but in the arm he should get at least some broken bones. Why doesn't that occur in the movie(appart from the plot armor that kinda saved captain america too in the end since it's his movie)?</p>
 <p>I live with my girl friend and her 5 year old son , and my 7 year old daughter . Recently they were found in the closet suspiciously . Her son had his boxers improperly outside his shorts . So his mom asked him at bed time what happened ? He said "naked stuff " . My girlfriend never told me she was expecting my daughter to bring it up and tell me . Couple days later it happened again they were playing in the closet . The next day my girlfriend asked her son what exactly went on . According to him he had his shorts down and my daughter touched his penis . I separately questioned my daughter about what had happened in the closet and she told me the same.. That her son was touching her private part . Me and my girlfriend are having problems over this situation . Suggestions of what should be done ? </p>

 <p>I'm so badly upset now! I'm working for a small company in Chennai, India for around 3 years. I was having a good relationship with my Team & management in the past years. But when i decided to leave my job after having a good offer from an MNC things are gone upside down. </p>

<p>I formally applied for resignation and asked the management that i can duly serve the 3 months notice period. The new MNC company also agreed for this 3 months Notice period.</p>

<p>But my current Employer is not accepting my resignation now & also want me to serve for one more year and they will not increase my pay during this period.</p>

<p>They are threatening me that if i resign now i will not get my Relieving letter and also they will not refer me in future. They say that they are completely under the legal bounds. I am so vexed and tried so hard to convince them that i can transfer my work to others in this 3 months notice period but they are totally disagreeing to this.</p>

<p>I'm a soft person and i did not spoke anything hard. </p>

<ol>
<li>How can i explain my situation to my new employer?</li>
<li>What are the legal things that i can take advantage of?</li>
<li>Would this affect my career?</li>
</ol>
 <p>Good day.</p>

<p>I have a complicated request from my client. I'm actually programming his website and he's an aesthetics surgeon. So he provides:</p>

<p>Services</p>

<li>Botox</li>
<li>Fillers</li>
<li>Hair Removal</li>
<li>Bla</li>
<li>Bla2</li>

<ol>
<li>Creams</li>
<li>Moisturiser</li>
<li>Wax</li>
<li>Bla</li>
<li>Bla2</li>
</ol>

<p>So each page e.g treatment creams has a form. How do I track this on Google Analytics after each form submission to achieve as a goal or conversion? I want to capture the flow of user after they have submitted the form and know which "form" is it from. Reason being that even if they are on eye creams product it doesn't mean they are interested. Only when they submit the form, then it's a success. Do I need one code? I don't wish to create individual landing page after every form submission just to track the "end page". There's a total of 50+ forms. Appreciate if you could explain the steps slowly.</p>
 <p>I'm quite new to survival analysis, but would appreciate any advice on how to deal with the following finding in my data analysis/ results interpretation. I have been using R and have used a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model to analyse risk factors for diabetic cats entering remission. I only have 46 cats in the study population and 13 remission events (patient recruitment is difficult in vet medicine.)</p>

<p>In univariate analysis, the following are significant:
1) BMI at enrollment (dichotomous, static covariate): HR 3.3 (95% CI 1.1-10) p= 0.04
2) Weight-loss (kg) (time-dependent covariate): HR 4.6; 95% CI 1.2 – 15.8; p=0.03</p>

<p>However, when entered into a multivariable model, both become non-significant (BMI has p-value 0.24 and weight change has p-value 0.17). I understand that this means neither remains significant in the presence of the other and wondered whether weight loss is the mediator for remission in cats with higher BMIs. I have looked into mediator analysis, but can find little on this when the mediator is a time-varying covariate. Does anyone think this is worth pursuing, or know whether it is possible using R?</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
 <p>So I need a data frame to look like this:
Brand    URL       Text
Nike     url 1    data from the url 1
Adidas   url 2    data from url 2
Puma     url 3    data from url 3</p>

<p>I know how to use rvest, but as a beginner in R I don't know how to create a function that will apply the same rvest function on each of the urls. </p>

<p>So I would need a function which if I put in read_html(x) 
x would be the url from each row</p>
 <p>I've got the starting weight in one cell. I've got goal weight in another cell. I've got a range of cells where the customer will input their weight every day. I want to have another cell that calculates and displays the percentage completion of their weight loss goal. Basically, I want to take the most recent value added to the weight tracking row and use that to calculate the percentage weight loss goal completion. I could do a percentage completion rate for each day and display them in individual cells under each weight each day, but I just want one cell to take care of that. My problem is getting that most recently added value into my formula. Any pointers on how I would go about that?</p>

 <p>Results:</p>

<p>Data Coding and Exploratory Data Analysis 
All data were entered into a single SPSS data file for analysis. Seven variables were 
coded: 
1. Sex 
2. Total amount of television viewing hours over the previous week 
3. Height in metres 
4. Weight in kilograms 
5. BMI</p>

<p>All continuous variables were initially analysed using exploratory data analysis 
techniques to (a) check for data entry errors, and (b) test the assumptions of normality and 
homogeneity of variance. Techniques included identifying data entry errors via visual 
Sex Differences in the Relationship 5<br>
inspection of histograms, stem-and-leaf plots and normality plots; inferential tests for 
normality, such as Levene’s test; and both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks 
tests for homogeneity of variance. 
All continuous variables exhibited high levels of positive and negative skew, with p 
= .000 for all normality tests. A range of transformations were attempted, however, none 
resulted in any notable improvement in the distributions of scores, so the original data 
were used for all subsequent analyses. Further, the homogeneity of variance assumption, 
using sex as the nominal variable, was found to be violated at p > .50 for all outcome 
measures. A reciprocal log-root transformation was applied to the sex variable, and 
subsequent testing found that the assumption had been met. 
Table 1 presents the descriptive results for all variables. These results clearly 
demonstrate strong and statistically significant sex differences in all measured variables: 
height, weight, BMI and television viewing hours. Females had significantly higher 
BMI’s than males, and watched significantly more television, clearly supporting the 
hypothesis that being female is causally related to both a increased BMI and watching 
more television. 
The overall correlations, and the correlations for males and females separately are 
shown in Table 2. For the overall sample, there was a strong and significant positive 
correlation between both BMI and weight, and television viewing hours. For all 
correlations, the relationship between television viewing hours and the two weight 
measures, weight and BMI, was statistically significantly stronger for males than it was for females. These correlations were all assessed using 2 analysis, which allows causal 
conclusions to be reached. 
Regarding sex differences, a series of paired samples t-tests demonstrated significant 
sex differences for all variables: height, t(3.33) = 34.71, p = .002; weight, t(38) = 1.79, p 
= .081; television viewing hours, t(38) = 3.49, p = .069; and BMI, t(37.18) = 6.58, p = 
.52. Examination of the descriptive statistics in Table 1 indicates that, on average, males 
were taller than females, whereas females were significantly heavier, had higher BMI’s 
Sex Differences in the Relationship 6<br>
and watched more television. All of these t-tests were based on unequal variance due to 
violation of the homogeneity of variance assumption.<br>
Discussion 
The hypothesis that there would be a strong and significant causal relationship 
between BMI, weight and television viewing hours was clearly supported. For the overall 
sample, as well as for the male and female participants separately, there were strong and 
significant correlations between the two weight-related measures and television viewing 
hours. This result accords with previous related research, and supports the long-held 
perception that television viewing, a passive form of entertainment for young adolescents, 
is related to a propensity to overweight. Most notably, however, given the nature of the 
research design, the present study is the first published investigation to demonstrate a 
causal relationship between television viewing and overweight. This result has important 
scientific and clinical applications in the area of adolescent obesity and strongly suggests 
that an intervention program that focuses on limiting, or even eliminating, television 
viewing, has a high probability of leading to substantial and permanent weight loss. 
Further, there were clear sex differences in the nature of the relationship between 
television viewing and BMI, with much stronger relationships evident for females. This 
result clearly argues for targeted interventions toward adolescent females, as it is clear 
from the results of the present study that the excessive television viewing is a more potent 
causal agent for obesity in females than males. This result also implies that females are 
engaging in less physical activity than males, an interpretation that is supported by the 
significantly higher level of television viewing hours for the female participants. 
Future research might choose to focus on evaluating well-designed interventions for 
reducing television viewing hours.</p>
 <p>The reason i ask is because a horse i have had winstrol in its system when tested in serum. The horses level was 315pg/ml. </p>

 <p>I have been asked to analyze the following laboratory experiment:</p>

<p>14 donors’ red blood cell samples are typed for rare antigen-asset recognition by an automated procedure (machine), which returns a score between zero and four (0=negative, 0.5 to 4=positive result) and have to be validated against a gold standard (reference score: 0=negative,1=positive), which is known. Three antigen systems (Fy, Jk, S) are tested, each using two serum-reagents to assess antigen-specific asset homozygosis/heterozygosis (‘a+,b-’ or ‘a-,b+’=homozygosis; ‘a+,b+’=heterozygosis).</p>

<p>Each sample is tested for any 2 out of 3 antigen systems (at random). For each antigen system tested on a sample, the sample is tested across three sessions (performed on different days), on six replicates within each session, with each of three replicates tested for asset ‘a’ and each of three extant replicates tested for asset ‘b’. I also understand that the 6 replicates for each sample are in random order (i.e. chosen by the machine) for multiple samples (n=9) tested within one single session.</p>

<p>Below, I report the data of one single sample tested for two separate antigen systems as an example.</p>

<p>The automated procedure is almost 100% accurate, as expected. However, the machine can also return a missing score in some circumstances (missing score=1). The hypothesis is that the proportion of missing scores might be influenced by the heterozygosis of the sample (which is system specific: i.e. it may vary within sample across sessions, which test different antigen systems). </p>

<p>I am assuming that replicates (my lowest level observations) are nested within the combination of sessions and blood samples (i.e. replicates are cross-classified within sessions by samples), which I consider as random effects. I am also interpreting the antigen specific-asset of the sample tested as a fixed effect. </p>

<p>I have been implementing (Stata 13.1) a logistic mixed model (see also <a href="http://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1337275-logistic-mixed-model-for-experimental-design-with-replicates" rel="nofollow">link</a> to Statalist). The outcome is whether the score is missing or not for each observation in the dataset. I specify the sample antigen-specific asset as a fixed effect at level one (comparing heterozygosis vs homozygosis), and samples cross-classified with sessions as random effects at level 2. </p>

<p>Would anyone kindly suggest whether I am interpreting and modeling this experimental design correctly? Any helpful comments gratefully received.</p>
 <p>The plot: A girl, maybe older teenager, is sleeping with her boyfriend in a secure film room when some catastrophe from space covers the earth with bad stuff. I think her boyfriend goes outside and is killed by those remaining who are all weirded up. She finds her younger sister and eventually a healthy guy (becomes the new boyfriend). One scene is in a shopping mall or big store like Macy;'s. The government is working on a fix and wants their blood for serum. At some point they are in a radio station. The rain washes away all of the bad stuff. Anyone know the title?</p>
 <p>I am trying to sort this items alphabetically but it is not sorting all items as it should be. Can you give me some ideas why it is not working ?

<p>Is it possible to fetch where sex=female by joining PT from all documents?  All the documents have details of a patient with different values. </p>
 <p>I recently got an iMac, but have been feeling anxious about using it as  the keyboard is made of aluminum as is also the actual computer.</p>

<p>the keyboard and computer are made from Anodized aluminum, while the 
base is made from aluminum and plastic, </p>

<p>How long does the anodization last? Like how long does it take for erosion to take place? I read somewhere salts and I think acids could erode it, but I have to check about that. Should I be concerned of amount of aluminum that could be reabsorbed into my skin over several years typing on the keyboard? Granted I could get another keyboard, though I really like the keyboard it came with. In addition, its difficult psychologically  because I guess I worry about just touching the on button to put the computer on..I could also use something else to touch it...but yeah thats just too much trouble over a computer.</p>

<p>The fears stem from a possible but apparently not proven link of alzheimers to increased aluminum in the body. </p>

<p>Considering this is not the same as dietary intake, I would hope that it should not be an issue, and also because its anodized aluminum, nevertheless I am seeking looking for assurance as the internet can be quite brutal and adamant about the position it takes. You know there are these other "health" sites supporting claims that it could cause Alzheimers.</p>

<p>I literally when to look for publications concerning aluminum alzheimers link. But it was not helpful..some of what I saw just perhaps scared me. Granted I did not literally read the whole article mainly just the Abstract. Nor did I commit my self to a period of time to look over the matter. </p>

<p>Anyway, yeah I have to make a decision soon to keep or return the iMac like less than two weeks perhaps; the anxiety is painful. If anyone could give me insight
concerning aluminum and anodized aluminum, if they can be transferred dermally and if so, how much is absorbed and if is significant. I read here that just a small amount is transferred dermally.

<p>In addition now to think of it the aluminum could be transferred to the mouth if you were to eat with it without washing hands.yeah not the kind of way I'd want to live worrying about this. </p>

<p>I think soda cans have aluminum s in the soda, but a computer is something I may use nearly everyday, for perhaps hours so..</p>
 <p>I've heard good things and bad about Mederma (<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Mederma-Skin-Care-Scars-1-76/dp/B000052YOB/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1461280340&sr=8-1&keywords=mederma" rel="nofollow">http://smile.amazon.com/Mederma-Skin-Care-Scars-1-76/dp/B000052YOB/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1461280340&sr=8-1&keywords=mederma</a>). </p>

<p>They claim to be the most recommended product (by doctors and pharmacists) for scar removal but my dermatologist said that there's no scientific study that supports them and that dermatologists usually don't recommend them.</p>
 <p>So, one of the example sentences, for ため, that I see in the learning software I use is:
彼女はダイエットのために泳いでいる。
...which basically means, "She swims in order to lose weight."</p>

<p>But what if you wanted to say, "She swims in order to lose weight, and for fun?"</p>
 <p>I'm looking for a way to add a smooth transition (scrollTop+fadeOut) on pages transitions.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I want to reproduce: <a href="http://www.versoskincare.com/skincare/" rel="nofollow">http://www.versoskincare.com/skincare/</a></p>

<p>So when you click on a thumbnail, all goes smooth. The URL change, the previous content disapears, the whole website scroll to top and then the new content appears.</p>

<p>I've looked at the source code of the website, it uses jquery.history to load the new content through Ajax. But can't find any other info...</p>

<p>Does anybody know how to do it?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for advance!</p>

 <p>Every time I download Nike Plus it just sits in my download box, Why doesn't my Nike+ download automatically</p>
 <p>I've sniffed data from COM port by Eltima Serial Port Monitor. And I've got 4 views of data: "Terminal view", "Line view", "Dump view", "Table view".</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tnicT.png" alt="Print screen of Eltima Serial Port Monitor session"></p>

<p>For my purpose I have to parse data, received from COM port, analyse  and understand how communication protocol works. But I don't understand, in which format data are coming in COM port. For writing parser on Python I use PySerial library and emulate COM port by HHD Software Virtual Serial Ports (unfortunately, now I haven't got possibility to use directly COM port, only sniffed data), where I've set up Input File in Port Type the exported file from Eltima Serial Port Monitor. I tried to export each of 4 views and work with them, but I would like to know, which format of raw data I receive from COM port. And I'm confused, why in Table view in column data there is byte "fd", but in Terminal view or Dump view there isn't byte "fd", for example. And also, why in exported file of Terminal view after each byte is added byte "00" except two byte "ac 20", which serve as delimiter possibly, but in Dump view these two bytes are represented like one byte "80".</p>

<pre>
       Exported from Terminal view                           Dump view
0a 00 0c 00 06 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 ac 20               0a 0c 06 00 20 00 80
0f 00 0a 00 0c 00 06 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 ac 20         0f 0a 0c 06 00 20 00 80
</pre>

<p>The main issue is the presenting raw data from COM port, especially how to export this raw data from session in Eltima Serial Port Monitor and further parse them in Python, although the programming language doesn't matter. And also I would like to clarify, how settings of baudrate, databits, parity, flow control, stopbits do impact on sniffed data by Eltima Serial Port Monitor. Is it possible, that I set up incorrectly these settings, when monitored and sniffed data from real hardware COM port, and as a result the data in different views of Eltima Serial Port Monitor don't match each other, or could I lose some data?</p>

<p>If you could advise something or make some comments, I will be very appreciative. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I have tried the following code but it doesn't recognize the text (it does work for numerical conditions though!).</p>

<pre><code>x <- subset(Hosp_coord, Hosp=="Foundation Trust")
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> returns as <code>" 0 obs. of 5 variables"</code></p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>
 <p>Hey everyone I am sorry if this is a really basic question, but I am fairly new to programming and still can't wrap my head around how to utilise lists and dictionaries correctly regardless of how much I have read. So basically I am just trying to simplify some code I wrote a while ago utilising these concepts.</p>

<p>I am trying to modify a program I wrote to calculate total weight lost and average weight lost per month. This is a bit of the code which I wrote and want to modify.</p>

<pre><code>months = input("How many months have you been trying to lose weight?: ")

def weeks():
    week1 = input("How many lbs did you lose in your first week?: ")
    week2 = input("How many lbs did you lose in your second week?: ")
    week3 = input("How many lbs did you lose in your third week?: ")
    total_weight_lost = (week1)+(week2)+(week3)
    return total_weight_lost,
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I am just trying to figure out if I can do this using a dictionary or list. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def weeks():
    d = {"week1": 0, "week2": 0, week3": 0}
    for k in d:
        total_weight_lost = input(" How much weight did you lose in", d, "?:")
    return total_weight_lost,
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is completely wrong but I am thinking there might be someway to do something like this. So that I can iterate through the Keys in the dictionary and get the user to provide the value without having to write the same line of code for 'week1' 'week2' and 'week3'. But not only that I want to repeat the function for every month the user says they were trying to lose weight and then calculate the totals. If anyone can point me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
 <p>I am currently doing a project to study the relationship between central obesity ( waist circumference) with serum concentration of IL-8 and TNF alpha.
I have got about 100 of samples and ELISA have been done to collect the results. I am really not familiar with the statistic, so I would like to ask some questions, I hope someone can help me out. It would be greatly appreciated
 1. What statistical tests should I used to study the relationship?
( parametric and non-parametric)</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>I have performed the normality test on SPSS but they come back P value = .000, which is non-normal distribution, am I supposed to transform the data into normal distribution by taking log10? and continue my analysis then?</li>
</ol>

<p>Really grateful if someone can answer my questions, I am really overwhelmed by the statistics... </p>

 <p>I am designing a single page mockup for a skincare brand and I was wondering what size would be best for the typical long page setup. 
Could someone also please advice the advantage of working with pixels as opposed to millimetres when setting up a page in photoshop..thanks!</p>
 <p>I'm trying to get the current men clearance shoes from the Nike store site using Angulars $http request and display it on my own site.</p>

<pre><code> $http({
        method: 'GET',
        url: 'http://store.nike.com/html-services/gridwallData?country=US&lang_locale=en_US&gridwallPath=mens-clearance-shoes/'
    }).then(function successCallback(response) {
        console.log('success',response);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
        console.log('error',response);
    }); 
</code></pre>

<p>However, it gives me this error.</p>

<pre><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://store.nike.com/html-services/gridwallData?country=US&lang_locale=en_US&gridwallPath=mens-clearance-shoes/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access.

<p>I know its a Cross-origin resource sharing issuse.  Is there any way to by pass this?  And also can I legally display their clearance products on my site?</p>

 <p>I am a USA female citizen.  I travelled as a tourist to Singapore several times, never overstayed, but I did usually stay nearly the maximum 90 days.  I have OCD and wash everything.  One time I got rejected when I tried to enter Singapore with a damp passport because I was told it was not in good condition.  I know that sounds stupid to present a damp passport but it gets worse ... also I got quite upset because I was being deported all the way back to USA and I did not want to go back.  It was a business class ticket on Singapore airlines and the airline was responsible to pay for my return so they did not like that and subsequently banned me.  I did get accepted back into Singapore as a tourist a year or so later, but had a few weird problems like getting caught for taking a shower at a resort swimming pool facility where I did not stay.  I had to leave Singapore in an odd way, with my passport held at the airport.  I had to collect it with a special letter on the day of my flight.  I tried to go back again to Singapore about a year after with a good quality passport but was refused for "secret reasons".  The officer did mention to not try again for at least 6 months.<br>
I love Singapore because it is tropical and clean.  I am not a criminal but my odd OCD behavior seems to have caused a problem with visiting.  I spend a lot of time in Thailand by the way and of course immigration there is different.<br>
Any suggestions how I can get another chance with Singapore?  I think I have learned my lesson about how to behave there and hope it is not too late.</p>

<p>And here's the output <a href="http://imgur.com/FQEptHj" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/FQEptHj</a> </p>
 <p>10 participants underwent a weight loss programme, like so:</p>

<pre><code>mydata<-as.data.frame(matrix(c(140,125,120,115,110,110,110,105,100,90,85,100,140,70,100,
100,140,120,220,190,90,100,120,60,90,110,130,110,120,140,NA,65,110,50,NA,90,120,NA,130,
150,NA,60,NA,45,NA,NA,110,NA,160,NA),nrow=10,dimnames=list(c(1:10),c("IQ","Weight.year.1"
,"Weight.year.2","Weight.year.3","Weight.year.4"))))
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder if IQ predicts weight loss success.</p>

<p>I should not compute the delta, i.e. <code>lm((Weight.year.1-Weight.year.4)~IQ,data=mydata)</code>, since heavier people have more potential to lose weight, and results would be biased. It also fails due to many missings.</p>

<p>One idea is to compute and use the person-specific coefficients, i.e. <code>sapply(1:10,function(i){lm(t(mydata[i,2:5])~c(1:4))$coefficients[2]})</code>, which, however, still is related to baseline weight.</p>

<p>I am looking to give it a new try with <strong>random intercepts</strong>, but sadly I do not quite understand how to code this in R.
Does anyone know of code to run such an analysis? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

<p>Kindest regards.</p>

 <p>Can someone explain to me why in a matched random assignment, the variance is also controlled in addition to the mean? And if it doesn't control for the variance, is there a random assignment strategy such that the mean and variance between groups is the same?</p>

<p>To illustrate: say there's a drug trial testing the efficacy of a weight-loss drug. A placebo and the drug is given to 1) a population with a known genetic predisposition for weight gain 2) people without this pre-disposition, but who eat a similar diet. How do we divy up the individuals so that the mean and variance are the same in all 4 groups?</p>
 <p>I have a problem with my AMPscript.
I would like to use the function AMPscript Add to add differents price from different products that are also connected with the count AMPscript function
e.g. 
"var @rsorder, @roworder, @rsitem, @rowitem, @counterorder, @counteritem,
@currentorder, @article_review_url,@size, @price
SET @rsorder = LOOKUPROWS("Abandon_Cart_ID", "customer_id",
[customer_id])
]%%
%%[
for @counterorder = 1 to ROWCOUNT(@rsorder) do
SET @currentorder = FIELD(ROW(@rsorder, @counterorder), "basket_id")
SET @rsitem = LOOKUPROWS("Abandon_Cart_ITEMS", "basket_id",
@currentorder)
if ROWCOUNT(@rsitem) != 0 then ]%%
%%[
for @counteritem = 1 to ROWCOUNT(@rsitem) do
SET @rowitem = ROW(@rsitem, @counteritem)
SET @url = FIELD(@rowitem, "article_link")
SET @price = FIELD(@rowitem, "PRICE")
SET @size = FIELD(@rowitem, "SIZE")
if MOD(@counteritem, 2)== 0 and @counteritem != 1 then
]%%"</p>

<p>So the formula is counting if there are more the one product and is insering the different variable inside the HTML so I cannot add together the differents price because it is finding only one price. (variable declared is @price)</p>

<p>Someone knows how I can solve this problem?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
 <p>The basic premise of the series is the main female character joins a department of all female officers; each chapter starts with the introduction of a a new female officer, with each new officer having some special power/technique/trait (invisibility, chi-control, long hair, nekomata, flexibility, etc).</p>

<p>One of my favorite scenes of the manga is when the main female goes shopping with some of the previously introduced officers. While they are lingerie shopping, the mall goes ablaze due to a vengeful arsonist. One of the officers gets really mad that she strips naked, covers herself in (which I guess is) extinguisher foam and jumps into a fire, towards the criminal; worried that she went alone, the main female does the same. The chapter almost end with an enticing low angle view of the two officers appearing infront of arsonist, naked, with bits of foam barely covering up their naughty bits, and comedic bit of the criminal's penis catching on fire after his aroused penis neared the flames he created.</p>
 <p>I have seen other tickets related to this, and have followed recommended steps. I have not been able to see new custom theme in admin section.</p>

<p>Here the steps I have done:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have created folder structure under 'Magento root'/vendor/myvendor/mytheme/</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VIooZ.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VIooZ.jpg" alt="Folders structure"></a>
.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Then I have added file: 'theme_dir'/theme.xml</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code><theme xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Config/etc/theme.xsd">
     <title>My Theme</title> <!-- your theme's name -->
     <parent>Magento/blank</parent> <!-- the parent theme, in case your theme inherits from an existing theme -->
     <media>
         <preview_image>media/preview.jpg</preview_image> <!-- the path to your theme's preview image -->
     </media>
 </theme>
</code></pre>
  
  <p>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3">
<li>Then I have added file: 'theme_dir'/composer.json</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>{
    "name": "myvendor/theme-frontend-mytheme",
    "description": "N/A",
    "require": {

            "registration.php"
        ]
    } }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>.
4. Then I have added file: 'theme_dir'/registration.php :</p>

<pre><code><?php /**  * Copyright © 2016 Magento. All rights reserved.  * See COPYING.txt for license details.  */

\Magento\Framework\Component\ComponentRegistrar::register(

    __DIR__ );
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li><p>Then I updated ''/dev/tools/grunt/configs/themes.js - just below luma:</p>

<pre><code>luma: {
    area: 'frontend',
    name: 'Magento/luma',
    locale: 'en_US',
    files: [

    ],
    dsl: 'less'
},
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li><p>Then deleted var from root</p></li>
<li><p>Then I flushed cache</p></li>
<li><p>Then I ran from CLI - in this step the new theme was not shown in logs:
magento setup:static-content:deploy</p></li>
<li><p>Then when I go to Admin/Content/Themes and I am not able to find new theme.</p></li>

 <p>I need to set up webpage with a player and a live stream that will feed it.
The page is HTML, and for a broadcasting medium I am using VLC (currently)</p>

<p>I am new to this thing, googling this problem is a nightmare and I got nowhere..
I though of using the HTML5 <code><video></code> tag but i couldn't get that working (even after following another article about this<code>*</code>).</p>

<p>I set the VLC stream at <code>port 8080</code> and with the page being <a href="http://localhost:8080/s.s" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/s.s</a> and the stream being <code>video -H.264 + MP3 (MP4)</code> format using <code>HTTP</code> protocol  for a test, the player just opens up but nothing plays at all.. i tried putting the same video in the directory and using </p>

<p>The HTML code:

    <source src="http://localhost:8080/s.s" type="video/mp4">
    something is wrong.
    </video>
</code></p>

<p>I thought of using a player (like JWPlayer / JPlayer) but I am not getting any good sources on how I can establish a live stream on them, they won't suffice either since I really need it to work on phones as they are the main target, so i thought of setting a link that can use a local player of the phone using the <code>video//</code> URL but I have absolutely no clue how to do that..
google is failing me horribly..
I don't really know what I am supposed to be looking for, or even if this method would even work at all and whether VLC is a good broadcasting medium, most searches point me to an advertisement or a live stream hostess, I need this all to be locally established.</p>

<p>Can I get a direction please? it would be most appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
What can i use for phones that would be able to stream videos?
I am aware that MX Player can stream live streams, but i can not find how to make the browser ask the user to use a local app.
an example is:

if you open it in an android phone then it should ask you to choose a program to open it with, i could not find this method online at all!
I really need some help.</p>

It has been changed to Structure Zoom and the toe box has become too pointy for me to wear them, but I still need the specific stability and cushion they provide.

 <p>I have a problem with division of bh register in Assembly x86
I think its a problem of trying to reach the same memory, as I have storage in the register bh but I cannot solve the problem on my own.
That's my code:</p>

<p>add $3, %bh    #I put the value in bh register
mov %ax, %bh    #As i want to divide what i have in bh register, i think i have to relocate the value to some other register but im not sure if i chose good one
mov $26, %bx #im going to the divide by 26
div %bx #here the division
mov %bh, %ah #and what i actually want is the modulo 26 result, which is said to be in ah register
mov %bh, buforout(,%edi,1) #and finally the result in the buforout</p>

<p>Which of the registers should i use not to mess with memory while division? I want to get modulo result.
Thank you for your help, i think that tipp will make it all clear for me with my further work</p>

 <p>I used to have a windows 7 laptop which after a long time ago started getting more and more slower.
Then after i bought a new Lenovo touch laptop it was really fast (at least at the beginning) Recently about 3-5 weeks ago my wifi on my laptop keept crashing it wouldn't go back online and the wifi was in away just gone.
There was just a red cross on the Connection sign. Now it has changed to a yellow emergancy sign and still does not allow me to connect to the internet. I have tried avira, avast, northon and all other anti spy ware anty malware anti trojan programs. I may be just stupid or it is really a nast virus. I have had on it many programs and today I uninstalled Android emulator and bluestacks.
Still though i cannot longer ignore the problem even if it connects once in a time. Yes i have tried restarting it and rebooting. My other laptop died of that and is in a loop now of booting. I still don't have wifi or any kind of Internet. It just once randomly appeared and now it is really getting a pain.
I have done a shortcut to my desktop for setup shortcut of wifi by intel and wifi shortcut. But constantly the DNS is changing. My Spyhunter and Reghunter sometimes detect things even though i still do not have wifi after removing it. I have spent more than 2 days again trying to find the problem/virus/malware/Trojan but i cannot longer stand it. I read on a forum that Mini tool box by Microsoft would help but it didn't. I did to try troubleshoot but that failed which I did not expect to work anyways.
The interesting thing was on my old laptop it wouldn't allow to charge my IOS and yet we have here the similar problem which does have wifi at the very beginning I believe at least sometimes and then it disconnects and goes. I was inside change network adapter and there the "Wifi" dissapeard today again.
On the Ethernet it says there would be a Network cable unplugged but i do not have a ealtek PCle GBE family controller.
I do have a virtualbox but that has eighter way too no internet. The actual reason why I deleted the Virtual phone generators (bluestacks and so on) is because they suddenly stopped working. I really do not know anymore what to do. I really need help I believe my laptop will die soon and end in a boot loop like my other one did. It by the way didn't work even before i had avira.
Please help me i need really help.

 <p>I want to use this API for my application, which can detect the "fake ID" and "fake Passports". I have read the documentation but did not find any thing related to this.
Please guide me if this is possible using Google vision API if it is not possible then please suggest how can I implement this functionality.</p>
 <p>A physician who has a group of thirty-eight female
patients aged 18 to 24 on a special diet wishes to estimate
the effect of the diet on total serum cholesterol. For this
group, their average serum cholesterol is 188.4 (measured
in mg/100mL). Because of a large-scale government study,
the physician is willing to assume that the total serum
cholesterol measurements are normally distributed with
standard deviation of σ = 40.7. Find a 95% confidence
interval of the mean serum cholesterol of patients on the
special diet. Does the diet seem to have any effect on
their serum cholesterol, given that the national average for
women aged 18 to 24 is 192.0?</p>

 <p>Sir i am an indian citizen who is currently in paris for internship program of 5 months. I hv lost my original passport and schengen VISA. What is the procedure for FIR in paris and how do i get them reissued again as soon as possible. Please help</p>
 <p>I'm redoing our master bedroom closet and the original doors were 1970 type sliding doors. The rough opening is 65.5". All the bedrooms already had a face-lift with wheat oak bi-fold doors and I would like to stick to the same trim and bi-fold door look.</p>

<p>The problem I have is the opening in the master bedroom is too wide or too narrow for bi-fold doors of the style we have. We can either get 30" doors which leaves 2 inches to make up with 2x4's or something else. The 36" doors are too wide.</p>

<p>So my question is what can I do to make the 30" bi-fold doors work? The trim going around the doors are 2.25" wide which would not cover the 2" space I need to make up and at least 1/2" of the jamb.</p>
 <p>I am trying to create a full width dropdown menu that is independent of the navigation, but is triggered by the one of the navigation items.</p>

<p>I am using the bootstrap accordion component to open and close the dropdown menu. The issue I am facing is that I can open the dropwdown menu and have it close when I leave the menu are using mouseLeave to collapse the accordion, and this works fine, but when I am only hovering through the menu items I need the dropdown menu to close when I leave that specific menu item. It stays open until the mouse leaves the actual menu itself, but I need it to open/close on hover and remain open when I want to hover over the drop down menu.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I can achieve this functionailty? or maybe how to re approach this situation?</p>

<p>The navigation menu is generated so I do not really know add classes or any markup to the menu item that is triggering the menu to open.</p>

<p>here's a link to the staging site. <a href="http://cohenplastic.staging.wpengine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cohenplastic.staging.wpengine.com/</a>
the effect will happen when you hover over the procedures menu button.</p>

 <p>I've accidentally got infested with a malware... I'm not the most tech savvy. It's firstputnik.ru. I tried running various anti-virus/malware software, but nothing seems to work. They don't detect it. SpyHunter is the only one that detects it, but I can't remove it unless I pay (which sadly I cannot do).</p>

<p>How do I get rid of it? I managed to reset my default search engine back to Google with</p>

 <p>I have submitted my wife's ITIN application (W7) along with 2012 federal tax return copy at the local tax office on 14th March 2013 in NJ.
The person at the tax office did verified my wife's Passport, W7 form and he returned few last papers from my TAX returns with a stamp on it stating "RECEIVED WITH REMITTANCE" and finally told us it will take 8 weeks to get the ITIN and Refund if my Refund is approved.</p>

<p>Again on April 15th I received a notice form IRS requesting original passport or certified copies from the authority who issued the passport even though IRS official has verified the original passport.
I chose the second option and certified the passport copies  from Indian embassy and did an express mail to IRS </p>

<p>did anyone has any issues even after sending the certified copies </p>

 <p>Hello I would like to know if is there such a way has to inject programming code into a video, so that for example if the video gets ripped from a website like eg: youtube.com; vimeo.com, that video loses all the video properties or becomes corrupted and displays a watermark like saying : facebook suck my penis.</p>

<p>Because I do know that facebook gets away stealing millions of views, and not crediting the proper content creators, so I wanted to know if there was such a way, so that it doesn't happen, and that if the video gets uploaded through another website and gets ripped the code that was injected on the video itself, gets activated and in that way corrupting the video , or disabling the video part.</p>

 <p>I've watched a sexistic show called 'die Heute Show', a bad cover of 'The Daily Show'. Caroline Kebekus made a statement:</p>

  <p>You (men) are all the same. The ideal AfD voter. Stupid and
  self-pitying. This uniquely assortment of big mouth (abusive word) and
  total uncertainty. [...] This is the primeval fear of German
  (condescending word) men: well equipped immigrants from the South make
  our women horny, because they have generally known a big ... charisma.
  [...] Welcome to the baboon hill.</p>

<p>Well, she also said that German men have a short penis and that all men are aggressive and love to shriek, because all men feel insecure. The moderator asked if that's not sexism. She answered no, it's a scientific fact that</p>

<p>I would like to know if there is any law against sexism? I remember the time where we saw men as superior to women, where I fought against sexism. I don't want to end there again, just with different gender roles. I don't think that discrimination is all right - not against women, not against men, not against Jews and not agains black people.</p>

 <p>im a torah observant jew and have some questions regarding halachah i was hoping perhaps you could answer for me.</p>

<p>is it permitted for a wife to massage her husbands prostrate (the sensitive part thats inside the anus) while the husband is not inside, of course with them being carefull that the husband doesnt finish? </p>

<p>during prostrate play, it is possible that clear liquid (not semen) flows or drips out of the penis without actually having an orgasm.
is this clear liquid considered seed? if so than it would definately be best avoided since we are careful about Gd forbid spillin seed in vain.</p>

<p>even though this may sound strange,
i would llike a halachic pask, about this, if prostrate fluids is considered spilling seed or not. i would also like to hear opinion according to strict halachah.</p>

<p>thankyou!</p>

<p>I have been struggling with a (possible) malware infection (possibly) to my system (an employer-provided laptop with licensed software only). As you can see in the image below (iFrame element and jScript name), I am getting these frequent pop-ups which keep bothering me every time I open a website. As always, the minute I try to close them (a close button appears when I hover my mouse over it), it opens up a new tab and takes me to suspicious websites.

<p>Before I resorted to taking SU's help and <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/100360/how-can-i-remove-malicious-spyware-malware-adware-viruses-trojans-or-rootkit">reading Joel Coehoorn's answer here</a>, I had scanned my employer-provided laptop with SpyHunter (free license) and Kaspersky Rootkit Removal Tool. I can't blindly follow Joel's suggested solutions without an unambiguous confirmation of the infection because I would have to submit it to my employer's lazy, good-for-nothing maintenance team who will assuredly take 2 weeks to do it while cutting corners and not being as thorough as Joel Coehoorn suggested. And during which I, a developer working in the IT dept, would be forced to use a substitute ancient with performance slower than Win98 on 64kb ROM.</p>

<p>Kaspersky Rootkit Removal tool found nothing whatsoever. On my personal laptop, I use a licensed copy of Kaspersky Internet Security, and it blocks these ads and shows me a <em>Malicious URL blocked</em> message every time I open a website. SpyHunter gave me the location of 3 cookie files that it identified as malware/spyware, which I promptly deleted. And, not so surprisingly, they keep popping up every now and then. </p>

<p>But I think the SpyHunter results are false-positives. Why? Because - and this is a curve-ball for me - I am getting these same pop-ups on other devices that <em>use my <strong>home</strong> WiFi connection</em> too, but which have <strong><em>never, ever, ever</em></strong> had a data-transfer with my laptop. Also, a friend of mine gets his internet connection from the same ISP, and he too is getting similar pop-ups. Now again, this does not rule out malware, his system too could have been compromised. Another important point, <strong>I don't get these ads when I connect to my office's WiFi connection</strong>. The office connection obviously has a host of professional firewalls and security measures implemented, but, and again, I don't think those measures are the reasons why I don't get the pop-ups on the office WiFi.</p>

<p>So, I would be very, very, very thankful if the community could help me out on this. I just need a concrete confirmation as to whether my system indeed is compromised or if it's my home router or the ISP itself. Also, is it possible that an infected system, when connected to an entirely new network, transmit sufficient details so as to compromise all systems on that network too, without the other systems doing anything whatsoever? Deep down I know this is possible, but not sure. Do clarify, please.</p>
 <p>Hi there I have a csv file with about 380k rows and tree columns.

 <p>So I've managed to recover a lot of formatted files (after Windows re-installation), with Remo Recover... however, some files cannot be opened. I am aware that this is because of fragmentation... Is there a way to fully recover these files ? Mostly MS office documents.</p>

<p>I heard <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec" rel="nofollow">this</a> software does a somewhat good job, so I'll give it a shot as well..
Looking through similar questions here on SU, I've found <a href="http://www.officerecovery.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.
Although I have a feeling that it's bs.  </p>
 <p>About a week ago, while browsing the internet - with my Lenovo S860 / Android / Chrome -, some popups came out, and initially i thought that the site has some ads, but it was something else. I've found an article about an adware that's auto-rooting your phone, and you can't get cleaned with hard-resetting, or scanning with any type of antivirus.
Ref: <a href="http://www.cmcm.com/blog/en/security/2015-09-18/799.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmcm.com/blog/en/security/2015-09-18/799.html</a></p>

<p>So, after connecting the device to my PC, (i think) the adware moved on my PC also. So now i have that virus on my phone, and also on my PC.
I've tried reinstalling browsers (Firefox, Chrome), reinstalling Windows - formatting HDD - scanning with different antiviruses (AVG, BitDefender, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, Spyhunter, AdwCleaner and many other) but without success.</p>

<p>The ads are appearing both in Firefox and Chrome, on different events - link click, background click.
On my phone appears a site, with the message "Your battery has [some number] battery viruses" and vibrates.
On my PC different sites are opened, like Alibaba, some radio websites. 
Any idea is appreciated!</p>

<p>Suspect domains included on webpages: </p>

<pre><code>ntvk1.ru
tarkita.ru
cukcopo.ru
darangi.ru
onclickads.net
morgdm.ru
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing is that i've found out that <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/i9avW.png" rel="nofollow">Google Analytics</a> is including these domains in the source - now i have blocked these domains and google-analytics.com in hosts file, but i don't think it's the best solution.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

 <p>A living cell is modelled as a small volume of fluid surrounded by a semi-permeable membrane having the following relationship between internal pressure and volume:</p>

<p>$$V = V_0 (1 + C \Delta P)$$</p>

<p>where $V_0 = 10^{-15} \text{m}^3$ is the volume of the cell when both internal and external osmotic pressures are in physiological conditions (7.3 atm at 37$^\text{o}$C), $C$ its compliance, and $\Delta P$ the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cell.
The cell is removed from the physiological serum and placed in a water solution containing a mass fraction of 2.5% sugar, maintained at 25$^\text{o}$C. Observation shows that the volume of the cell then increases by 25%. What would be the compliance $C$ of the cell membrane in this model, assuming $C$ does not depend on temperature?</p>

<p>The answer is supposed to be $1.1 \text{Pa}^{-1}$. Please show how we may arrive at this.</p>

Please help me. </p>
 The movie starts with a mom and dad having their daughter locked up in her room because she had a breast enlargement and seeks out sexual activity.

Then some random guy turns up in town and ... <p>I'd like to reformat / reset my verizon Samsung S4 (SCH-I545, baseband **OF1, Android 5.0.1). After doing a number of tests and experimentation, I believe that there is a malicious binary sitting in /system which is causing me to follow a random Russian porn Instagram account. I'd like to get rid of whatever is causing the auto-follow (it's not even good porn), so I thought a hard reset / reformat would be ideal... HOWEVER, I believe that a factory reset does not touch /system. Is there a recommended approach with a non-rooted phone to essentially start with a blank slate?</p>

<p>The phone itself was never rooted, but it did come refurbished a year or so ago from Verizon. Since it's running a OF1 baseband, I believe rooting it is out of the question? If it's possible to root, that might solve a lot of problems.</p>
 <p>I've added several select boxes to the WooCommcerce checkout page and everything works fine except for two things that I'm not sure about. </p>

<p>Validation and applying the same styles as the rest of the select boxes on the page. </p>

<p>Things I know. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>WooCommerce is using the older select2 library.  </p></li>
<li><p>When I add the below script to my child-theme .js file it styles
the select boxes correctly on the checkout page but breaks all other        select boxes on the site, despite the order of which my .js file is loaded.
Beginning,middle,last. 
      jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery(".select").select2();      });  // END document ready`</p></li>

How ... I don't masturbate or watch porn or any of that nasty stuff, but sometimes i get a really big temptation to do it. Granted i do resist, but i don't think i can for much longer. Is there any non-haram ... <p>To test the effectiveness of a diet, a random sample of 16 female patients is drawn from a population of adult females using the diet. The weight of each individual in the sample is taken at the start and at the end of the diet. Assume that the population of differences in weight before and after the diet follows a normal distribution. Suppose the mean decrease in weights over all 16 subjects in the study is 4.0 pounds. Assume the true standard deviation of differences computed as 6.4 pounds. Let μx −μy equal the mean weight before the diet minutes the mean weight after the diet.</p>

<p>(a) Test the null hypothesis at the five-percent level that the diet is ineffective against the alternate hypothesis that it helped patients lose weight. Report the null and alternative hypothesis, the decision rule, and the appropriate test statistic.</p>

<p>(b) A large-scale study conducted one year later finds that diet works, but that its true effect, on average, is minor. The average (population) difference overall is a one-pound weight loss. What was the power of our test from part (a)?</p>

<p>(c) Suppose we wanted to conduct a new study of the same diet, but we want to conduct our sample only with men. Assume that the population difference is the same for men and women: on average, it leads to a one-pound weight loss. What is the minimum sample size that we would need to obtain 80% power?</p>

<p>This is what I have done so far for (a), but I am unsure how to start on (b) and (c).</p>

<p>n = 16, d(bar) = 4, s(bar) = 6.4</p>

<p>H0: μx −μy <= 0</p>

<p>H1: μx −μy > 0</p>

<p>Reject H0 if t > t15,0.05 ==> Reject H0 if t > 1.753 (from t dist table)</p>

<p>t = d(bar) / (s(bar)/sqrt n) = 4 / (6.4/sqrt 16) = 2.5</p>

<p>As t = 2.5 > 1.753, therefore reject H0.</p>

<p>Any help on (b) and (c)?</p>

How ... <p>I have a scientific instrument which is controlled by an old computer running SCO Unix. I would like to write a Windows application to control the instrument to get rid of the old Unix machine.</p>

<p>I have been able to monitor the serial communication between the Unix PC and the instrument and have determined the setup of the serial port (baud rate, data bits, stop bits, etc.). The initial communication between the PC and the instruments is the PC sending a string of 18 null (00) characters and the instrument responding with another string of null characters.</p>

<p>I then connected my Windows PC directly to the instrument and sent a string of 18 null characters to the instrument (using Eltima Software Serial Port Monitor) but there was no response from the instrument. I have tried all variations of flow control and parity settings yet still can't get a response from the instrument.</p>

<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
 <p>I have created some lists using html and css. I want to display my custom taxonomies according to this design. For this reason, I have registered a custom post type named "surgical" with a custom taxonomy named "surgical_cat".  I want that when I create categories it would display as lists with 4 columns. And when I click any category, it brings me to a specific page (for example 'Categories') where display all posts under such category.</p>

 <p>When everyone just used animated GIFs, I could download a ton of animated GIFs, put them in one folder. I'd open one of the GIFs with Ifranview and then use the arrow keys to go from one GIF to the other for viewing pleasure/browsing.</p>

<p>Now, many websites are using MP4 or other file formats instead of GIFs. And Ifranview can't open mp4s. VLC can open mp4s but I can't move to the next short mp4 loop easily using the arrow keys on the keyboard. And also sometimes, I will have a folder that contains both GIFS and some short mp4 loops. </p>

<p>I'm really blank on it. Really I need a help. Thank you.</p>
 When calculating the incidence on producers and consumers using a demand and supply curve is dead weight loss a part of the incidence? I know that for example the producer's incidence is a rectangle ... <p>First I apologize for the English , if they do not understand something , I do not much management and dificult me a little.</p>

<p>I try to make an android app similar to a dictionary, in which I should display a video according to a word you enter for found.
The problem is that a file of video in <strong>.mp4</strong>  <strong>(1 a 2 MB)</strong> is very heavy and would take all the device memory when there are many words and videos.</p>

<p>In trying to resolve this, consider creating animated gif as light as possible without much quality image, to do this, use the <a href="http://xmodulo.com/convert-video-animated-gif-image-linux.html" rel="nofollow">ffmpeg</a> tool in linux with which I convert a video to gif image, while ImageMagic to try compress and even pass it to black and white to reduce their weight.</p>

<p>But in spite of doing this, I could not get gif size decrease more than 50% if you want.
I modified the number of frames, the delay of gif, I have turned black and white, but the weight loss is not as great as I would like and I will have a lot of imagemes on the server which will be downloaded to the device.</p>

<p>My question would be </p>

<p>Is optimal convert the video to GIF ? Or maybe they know of any other alternative that is more optimal and to display it in Android mobile devices ?</p>

<p>I have reviewed some links and seen to do animations with html5 canvas, not if you can show or use in android,
but also could create some thread so arming sequence images animation.</p>

<p>I have seen these links : (sorry , I can't put more than 2 hyperlinks)</p>

<p>*animated gif VS video VS canvas for speed file size: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17570445/animated-gif-vs-video-vs-canvas-for-speed-file-size">animated gif vs video vs canvas - for speed & file size</a>:</p>

<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/~jps/animated_gifs_the_hard_way.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sublimetext.com/~jps/animated_gifs_the_hard_way.html</a></p>

<p>But not if they can be used in android, since the process of compressing do on a server and then downloaded to the mobile device.</p>

<p>What do you think is the most optimal option as the case may expose previously?</p>

<p>I hope you can help me and thank you for your time and help.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
 <p>Day before yesterday, everything was working without a problem. My notebook (<a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/fts/products/computing/pc/notebooks/lifebook-a514/" rel="nofollow">Fujitsu A514 Lifebook</a>) was running Debian testing amd64 on kernel 4.2. I put it to upgrade, and it ran completely. Then suddenly, yesterday, when I booted up the laptop in the morning, I got the totally unexpected error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning Bootable device was not found. [Continue]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On continuing, it gave me the list of the bootable drives</p>

<ol>
<li>Kingston SSD 120G</li>
<li>CD/DVD Drive</li>
<li>Network</li>
</ol>

<p>Selecting the Kingston (my primary boot drive)  gives</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Setup Warning Boot failure [Continue]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially, thinking it to be a data glitch, I wiped the drive completely, and installed Debian 8 again. Installation goes smooth, as it should on a 25 days old SSD, but on booting the OS from drive, same error.</p>

<p>Doubting a dead SSD, I replaced the drive with a WD 500GB hard disk and tried to boot from it, but exact same error. In both the cases, the SSD and the HDD are detected by the BIOS, the installation goes smooth, with no errors when partitioning and stuff, but fails when booting from drive.</p>

<p>Today, I installed Ubuntu 15.10 that I freshly downloaded, and installed it to the drive. The installation went smooth, and successfully, but like the case with Debian, on rebooting to drive, I got the "Warning Bootable device was not found. [Continue]" error.</p>

<p>My notebook is 25 days old, so the possibility of a disk failure (in fact, 2 brand new disks) is pretty low. I searched nearly every forum with similar title but nothing worked.</p>

<p>Summary of what I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing complete wipes, reinstalling from multiple ISOs to minimize the
possibility of corrupt image.</li>
<li>Tried BIOS and UEFI</li>
<li>Tested multiple drives to make sure it is not a dead drive. </li>
<li>BIOS reset. </li>
<li>Battery Removal and reinsertion suggested on some forum.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the BIOS is not getting the path to the OS (I completely lack the knowledge about the boot up procedure), or something is preventing it from doing so.</p>

<p>Tried Fujitsu's support number, but didn't connect. I am really out of ideas right now, and hence this question.</p>
 <p>Am having a 6 html files in which am configuring the ngroute using angular js, each html file has images jquery slider and I have used the node express web server as server where it is running on 3000 port if I start my server and i open my browser and load the localhost:3000 am able to get the index.html file and its content if am navigating to other menu link am not able to get the content of that html file but its loading the preloader only, I post my HTML and angular js code below please do correct me any thing wrong </p>

 <p>This is my first post, therefore I'm sorry for anything newbie. I have created a piece of code in VB.Net to create a wall of text. Image >>>>>> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TtbFs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/TtbFs.jpg</a>

 <p>See we can download files from file hosting sites, but there is no warning on it.</p>

<p>but this security warnings present on torrent sites but not on file hosting sites, why so? </p>

<p>See here this picture i encountered. 
<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxPDs.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxPDs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>See Another similar case I found :  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In October 2010 Axel Braun
  Productions filed a complaint regarding with the United States
  District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia for legal
  action to be taken against 7,098 individuals who had illegally
  downloaded the Batman XXX: A Porn Parody through <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> file
  sharing sites. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>see here Axel Braun Productions didn't file complaint
on illegally downloads from file hosting sites, why so?</p>

<p>From this real happened incident, can I declare downloads from file hosting sites  are <strong>10000%</strong> safe? </p>
 When googling a person being interviewed for a show to obtain information a porn site showed up in its stead and I was unable to report it, remove it.
This is the page that showed up on my screen:

... <p>In this assignment you are expected to develop a generic function for Android mobile phone to calculate the cost of electric consumption based on the electric meter readings.
The requirements are as follows:
1 An input screen contains:
- Current meter reading.
- Service Number of the customer (10 digits alpha numeric).
2 The library should Do the following
- Record current date and reading values on the device
- İf previous reading was recorded for the same customer before get and display the last reading and calculate only the difference.
- Calculated cost based on:
3 The category calculations is monthly based – the breakdown of the consumption is based on monthly consumption only -
4 Cost should be calculated on a category based . and for each category different calculation method i.e.
- from reading A to B on one month is 25 pt./meter
- from reading B to C on one month is 35pt./meter</p>

<p>First example if this is the first time to caculate the cost and reading is 45 KW, Category A starts from 0 and Category B starts from 50 then caculation will be as follows:
    45 KW* 25 pt = 1,125 pt</p>

<p>Second example if this is the first time to caculate the cost and reading is 100 KW, Category A starts from 0 and Category B starts from 50 then caculation will be as follows:
    50 KW* 25 pt + (100 KW-50 KW) * 35 pt = 3,000 pt</p>

<p>Third example if this is the second time to caculate the cost and reading is 150 KW, Category A starts from 0 and Category B starts from 50 and last reading of previouse month was 100 KW. then caculation will be as follows:
This month reading = 150-100 = 50 KW
    50 KW* 25 pt =1,250 pt</p>

<p>5 You should develop your own algorithm for the cost and category calculation. 
6 The categories and calculation should be configurable.
7 There should be a user interface for the application to enter the required values and get the result.</p>
 <p>i have json file like (part of josn copied) below. root node is 'id' and child nodes are 649628086816907264, 649599667668451328 and so on.... All child node have different unique names. in python i want to extract all the element and attributes(valus starts from created_at) from all the child node and save in a json file.Can you help me</p>

 <p>I'm finishing up with a free course on web development.  Our main project was to develop a website.  I have basically finished but would like to improve the functionality of the bootstrap carousel.  I'm still trying to figure it out.  I have both horizontal and vertical photos in the carousel.  The ideal scenario would be to center all the photos in the carousel and have them still be responsive.  The issue I have now is that when the are stretched on a larger screen the photos look terrible.  I'm very new to all of this... so any insight or advice would be highly appreciated.

 <p>here goes a very vague one, I hope someone can recognize this movie.
It was shown on HBO, or maybe Cinecanal latino on late 90's or early 2000's. I got it by the middle, so i didn't get the plot very well.
It was a sci-fi movie about a group of space travelers (all young, around 20-30 years old), boys and girls wearing full body space suits (maybe white for girls?) without helmet and small laser guns. They seemed to be stuck in an other planet and settled on some one floor futuristic base, which was attacked by aliens or robots maybe.
The thing is it has lots of female nudity (breasts and full frontal) and some sex scenes, girls were pretty hot. It didn't seemed like a porn movie, it was more like a low budget film with no famous actors. (like star-ship troopers but with lower budget and more nudity).</p>
 <p>I have downloaded and set the theme according to the Themefactory site and other SO posts but the theme is just loading as pure html. </p>

<p>This is my code and file directory setup >>>> <a href="http://prntscr.com/96v20p" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/96v20p</a></p>

<p>Does anyone see anything wrong???</p>

 If you're using a slogan in a sentence in to describe something in an adjectival way, should the first letters of the slogan be capitalized, or not. e.g. Nike has a 'just do it' attitude to business. ... I wrote this sentence and I would like to know whether the word "cleverly" is positive, negative (like e.g. cunningly) or neutral.

... <p>I have a fasta file containing genome sequences of multiple viruses.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>>gi_138375030_Human_papillomavirus
GAAAGTTTCAATCATACTTTATTATATTGGGAGTAAAAAAAA...

>gi_94481944_Human_herpesvirus_3
GGCCCAGCCCTCTCGCGGCCCCCTCGAGAGAGAAAAAAA...
</code></pre>

<p>I want to extract only herpes virus entries, including the actual sequence, which is (in this file) always the line folowing the description.</p>

<p>The folowing regex works:</p>

<pre><code>>.*herpes.*\n.*\n
</code></pre>

<p>It selects the description and the sequence lines.</p>

<p>I have found similar questions but all make use of the "bookmark line" function:
<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/477628/export-all-regular-expression-matches-in-textpad-or-notepad-as-a-list">Export all regular expression matches in Textpad or Notepad++ as a list</a></p>

<p>However, this only bookmarks the first line of the regex output, so I am unable to use the described solutions. If I use "find all in current document", it also only lists the first lines.</p>

<p>All I want to do is copy the output of regex into a new file. It is especially frustrating since it finds just above a hundred entries, which is just above the margin under which I would be willing to do it manually.</p>

<p>I would prefer a solution in Windows OS.</p>

 <p>I would like a 2U to 4U chassis ( 2U ideally ) that can securely mount as many 3.5" HDDs in it while still having room for fans in either the front, back or both.  Wiring and SATA connections would be run to adjacent servers and 12V power sources so there must be enough room to allow this.  Room for SAS expander boards is not required.  Where can I find a cheap chassis that would support this?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://porn.serverbear.com/post/34433159138/open-vault-storage-a-2u-30hdd-storage-enclosure" rel="nofollow">Open Vault Storage a 2U-30HDD storage enclosure</a> would meet my needs but I don't see any direct way to purchase this server or enclosure.  Likewise, the Wiwynn S*7110 line looks promising, but no Internet pricing is posted.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in any enclosures that only house drives in the front of the unit.  For example, <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/nfo/chassis_storage.cfm" rel="nofollow">Super Micro's top and double-sided solutions</a> look good, but pricing I've found starts the SC946ED at $9K+ ..</p>

<p>Other than building the chassis myself ( which I'm prepared to do ), are there any alternatives that would be cheaper?  All suggestions welcome.</p>

 <p>I am trying to calculate the delta of an option at different strike prices where the underlying has a pronounced implied volatility skew in order to correctly hedge an options strategy. </p>

<p>Researching on the net and previous questions on this site imply that BS can be used, but input of the correct IV is the hard part. Tags like "the wrong number in the wrong formula to get the right price", "sticky delta vs sticky strike", "skew adjusted delta" and Derman's work are the solutions I have found so far.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me if these are the latest or best methods, or is a stochastic vol model like SABR or Heston better? Is calculating one value for the position delta too optimistic - should the position delta actually be a range with associated confidence limits?</p>
 <p>I am a Muslim, and so is my husband. Our 8 year old son is refusing to learn how to offer namaz and does not offer prayers either, and in his school, he has been slapped and beaten by teachers for questioning the righteousness of God. (In my country, which is Pakistan, it is common for boys to be beaten to motivate them to learn, this happens in every school with the exclusion of international ones, which are extremely expensive.)</p>

<p>Recently, he came back home with half of his face completely red. When I asked him what happened, he told me that his teacher slapped him hard for asking "Why is God so hungry for praise?" and although this doesn't sound too much cruel in English, in Urdu, it was said in a very harsh and informal manner, which was "Khuda itna bhuka kiyun hai tarifen or namaz key liye?"</p>

<p>And this isn't the only time he did something like this with God. Some time earlier, we had the following conversation;</p>

<p>Him: "Mom, Molvi (a scholar) was telling me that in the Quran, it is said that God has already written every second of our lives down, he has decided everything already he said. Is this true?"</p>

<p>Me: "Ofcourse!"</p>

<p>Him: "So when everyday, people are killed on the streets like they say on the news, and when those bombings happened some time ago here, lots of people died. And since God decides every second of our lives, did he decide the killers to go and kill them? That God himself is the killer and not us?"</p>

<p>My husband very quickly shouted at him and told him not to say things like this ever again, but he does it again and again whenever the topic of religion is touched. He is very curious, but sometimes, he gets too curious!</p>

<p>And I must also mention that once with my husband, he was asking who wrote the Quran, and my husband replied that it was God, then he asked did somebody see him doing it, that is there a video of it, my husband replied no ofcourse, then he said how do we know that God was written the Quran?, to which my husband replied that it was given to Prophet Muhammad by an angel, and then he asked whether there was a video or anything of it, and my husband replied no, and then he said "Dad, so how do know that there really is God?"</p>

<p>I must also add here that he does not have the Internet, and we have never let him use the computer. Everyday, he comes back home and reads the mathematical and scientific books like Principia, Conics, Elements, Posterior Analytics..etc which my husband has (which are many). And my husband told me that nowhere in these books something against God is written and infact, many of these books actually speak of God reverently. (since they are old)</p>

<p>He keeps doing these things often, and I am afraid that one day, he will get us in a very bad situation. I do not want the scholar at school or anybody to say that we should kill him, which is becoming more and more possible. (<strong>In Pakistan, there is a law set by the government that anybody, of any age, will be hanged for speaking vilely against God.</strong>)</p>

<p>And I cannot ask anybody for help in this case, the answer will very surely be "Beat the blashempy out of him!". And I do not want that. Is there a way I can make my son realize that there is a God, or if not, then how can I teach my son not to say things like these infront of anybody ever again and just listen? (We have already tried telling him nicely, but he never acts accordingly.)</p>

<p>In this fiddle, The table format is like this,
<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKvGF.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/cKvGF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>In this how can I add scrollbar for table data. I want the below format.
<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kGTnE.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/kGTnE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
 <p>So I recently got a job at a cellphone company. Don't get me wrong. I love the job. it taught me a lot of things. I love the people there and my boss. But I had a very uncomfortable situation with some customers that did not sit well with me. They were sort of harassing me. At one point, One of them said they watched asian porn that had someone look like me. It made me feel very very uncomfortable. I thought it was whatever wouldn't have to deal with the customer ever again. But i noticed a lot of these customers staring at my chest even when i'm wearing a baggy shirt.  One actually sniffed me and said i smelt good and gave me a creepy look. </p>

<p>I stared to feel increasingly uncomfortable going to work. And another contribute to as why I feel like i might want to quit is that, the smell from the restaurant next doors gives me a really really bad head ache. Every time i get off work. It makes me feel sickly. </p>

<p>So my question is, Is it wrong for me to quit the job on those standards? I've only worked for a month. But that incident with the male customer hasn't left my mind and I don't know how to bring it up with my employer. I feel bad if I quit because the company spent time with me to train me and teach me all these new things and they would have to hire someone new since they are short on staff.</p>
 <p>I have this Database:</p>

<p>And i want to sum up the "Model" in the lines Where "ID-Brand-PN" is the same</p>

<p>This is how i want my new Table to look:</p>

... <p>I am new in the Java department and I need some help. I am currently doing an app that will have many exercises (for working out) which each contain 5 different strings. then they are linked to workouts that are basically arrays of exercises. (but more than one workout can have the same exercise and I don't want to waste memory). And then workouts are displayed in different categories (weight loss, body building, etc..). If I was doing this in C (which is the language I usually program in) I would have the exercises to be an array of a structure called exercise, then the workout would be linked lists with each link being a pointer to the exercise, with an int for reps and an int for sets. And the workouts would be organized in an array of pointer pointing to the first element of the linked list (so a workout can be in multiple categories). Is there a way to implement something like that in java?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

Ideally I would like the search bar to appear on the right hand side after all the tabs/pages.  I have the required html coding for the search bar and its accompanying css coding however I don't understand how I should go about piecing together the coding for the search bar with the coding for the navigation bar.

<p>I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could help me with this issue. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Iram</p>
 <p>Would anyone know how I can remove the wonderlandads.com pop-up virus from my Nexus 5 mobile - it appears in my Chrome browser. While there are many sites dedicated to the manual removal of the virus from PCs, despite several searches I am at a loss to find a suitable alternative solution for Android. I have installed the free versions of AVG, Avast and Kapersky to no avail, and I am wary of those sites which suggest SpyHunter etc as a solution, for a fee. Any help, advice or suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
 Asalamualaikum, Ever since June I have been going through a very tough time. It started off with me doing a water fast to lose weight. Stupid idea. I wanted to do 15 days and only lasted 3. I got very ... <p>I want to make a youtube search in <code>Islamic</code> country so I need to filter out those videos which is <code>anti-Islam</code> like Porn, sexy, songs etc. 
Currently I'm using youtube data api v3 for searching videos, but I want when ever user search it filter the search according to specific content, remove those videos which is <code>anti-Islamic</code>.<br>
Is there any way to do that.<br>
Thanks.... </p>
 <p>There is a question <a href="http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/4055/what-does-scientific-research-say-about-the-relationship-between-penis-size-and">What does scientific research say about the relationship between penis size and attractiveness?</a></p>

<p>This  <a href="http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/4055/what-does-scientific-research-say-about-the-relationship-between-penis-size-and/4057#4057">answer</a> and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3aHuman_penis_size/Archive_2">link</a> give the statistics of penis size. Given these statistics, the average man performing in porn, would likely be in the top 2.5% of the population of penis size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Porn stars are <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/the-predicktor-2013-02-11">statistical outliers</a>, not the norm; men are more likely to be over 6’3” than to have a penis longer than 7.5 inches.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also "appears" that men may be inclined to having poor self-perception, regarding their penis size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size">Males self-perception</a><br>
  Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others, because of the foreshortening obtained from looking down, due to repeated observation of atypical penises in pornography, or because of the accumulation of fat at the base of the penis.[34] A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises.[35] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that men are the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/05/25/1179601669066.html">main consumers</a> of pornography, why does pornography feature so many men, out of the norm for penis size?<br>
Would it be more appealing to men, if the men starring in porn, had average sized penis?    what is the psychology behind using men with such, abnormally, large penis?</p>
 <p>I have a section in my site where four different promotion thumbs are displayed.</p>

<p>There is an info div that shows more info about the promotion.</p>

<p>Thumbs have an onclick that call a function in javascript that updates the current displayed text in the info div.</p>

<p>I have state in the CSS that I desire a 0.3 transition for the info div, it is applied but it does not trigger of from the change of text in the div. Naturally some promos have more content than others.</p>

<p>My idea with this is that I want the info div to transition height when looking thru promotions, instead of just flat change in height.</p>

<p>The site is live and works. Here is a direct link to the page with the promos thumbs.</p>

<p>LINK >>>>>>> <a href="http://thezone.bg/promo" rel="nofollow">http://thezone.bg/promo</a>  <<<<<<<< LINK</p>

<p>I wouldn't like to sophisticate it too much, I aim for a simple solution to the problem.</p>

<p>I would like to thank in advance for your time and effort in solving this problem.</p>

 <p>I have a section in my site where four different promotion thumbs are displayed.</p>

<p>There is an info div that shows more info about the promotion.</p>

<p>Thumbs have an onclick that call a function in javascript that updates the current displayed text in the info div.</p>

<p>I have state in the CSS that I desire a 0.3 transition for the info div, it is applied but it does not trigger of from the change of text in the div. Naturally some promos have more content than others.</p>

<p>My idea with this is that I want the info div to transition height when looking thru promotions, instead of just flat change in height.</p>

<p>The site is live and works. Here is a direct link to the page with the promos thumbs.</p>

<p>LINK >>>>>>> <a href="http://thezone.bg/promo" rel="nofollow">http://thezone.bg/promo</a>  <<<<<<<< LINK</p>

<p>I wouldn't like to sophisticate it too much, I aim for a simple solution to the problem.</p>

 Did Matt Damon lose weight to look that skinny in The Martian or was that a body double?
 <p>My 15 month old has suddenly started waking at night crying. We go into her room to try to comfort her, and sometimes bring her into bed with us, but our presence seems to make things worse. Sometimes she screams and becomes so hysterical that nothing will calm her down for 30 to 40 minutes. In between these episodes, and during the day, she is otherwise totally normal and her daytime behaviour has not changed.</p>

<p>Are we dealing with separation anxiety or is this closer to night terrors? She always seems awake and aware when she has a screaming jag. We haven't had trouble waking her, so I am thinking it could be separation anxiety. We recently took a 3 week vacation overseas and it was hard for her to adjust to the time change and jet-lag...could that be the reason for these outbursts?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, these tantrums are very scary...I am not sure now whether I should pick her up at night or not. I can't stand the thought of letting her scream alone...and when I go to her and try to comfort her while leaving her in the crib she becomes even more angry.</p>
 aslam o alikum i am a muslim 15 years old i have commited bad sins i masturbate 3 to 4 times a day i watch porn and i am a gay i.e i have been doing oral sex with a friend from 2 years i even took ... <p>I'm writing in regards to an issue I've encountered with the css coding for the hovering navigation bar and its tabs dropdown menu options. The link to my blogger blog is as follows: <a href="http://www.blankesque.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blankesque.com</a>. </p>

<p>I have three tabs/pages in the hovering navigation bar that have dropdown menu options that appear when the mouse/cursor hovers over the relevant text. The issue I'm having however is that when the cursor or mouse hovers over one of the tabs/pages text - in this case they are titled 'Blankesque', 'Social' and 'Features' - the dropdown menu options overlap the tabs/pages title. Ideally I would like to have the dropdown menu options to appear below the relevant titles instead of overlapping and covering them.</p>

<p>Any help with this issue will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Iram</p>
 <p>A few days ago Tumblr started to roll out a new "chat" feature. Usually, Tumblr updates seem to be spreading server-by-server (e.g. my US friends have them a few hours before me). But this time, Tumblr devs are using a strategy which immediately got nicknamed "Tumblr herpes": when user has the chat feature, they can "pass" it to other users by initiating chat threads with other users (up to 50 threads per day).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from my limited webdev experience and some googling, this seems to be a (re)deployment strategy: there are several servers running the tumblr code, and the devs need to add the new module without taking the website offline. But how does it really work, and why do it like this and not server-by-server as usual?</p>
 Meu site é como um portal, ele redireciona os usuários para outros sites (sites que «podem» conter material adulto/gore/porn etc), mas o conteúdo não está diretamente relacionado com o meu site, ... aslam o alikum i am a muslim 15 years old i have commited bad sins i masturbate 3 to 4 times a day i watch porn and i am a gay i.e i have been doing oral sex with a friend from 2 years i even took ... <p>I am trying to figure out a way to print certain patterns which are not regular. like NIKE sign with stars. One approach i thought of is to print a matrix of squares, say 10 X 10 and then decide a logic to fill in characters in a way that it does not cross max (10). Any other suggestions?</p>
 Morally questionable choices made Fallout and Fallout 2 the iconic games they are (becoming a slaver, kill children, prostituting my spouse, be a porn star, etc.). Those choices were totally absent ... My 4 month baby was born in UK and has just received US citizenship and US passport. We are in the process of getting the UK passport too but that is going to take another couple weeks.  I want to ... <p>I would appreciate some help with an issue I've come across whilst coding my blogger blog - <a href="http://www.blankesque.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blankesque.com</a>.</p>

<p>I would like the tabs / 'page' links to appear on the right hand side of the screen. I have managed to do this with the three dropdown menu tabs / 'pages' links however the tab link which doesn't have a dropdown menu - titled 'contact' - doesn't appear alongside the other elements on the right hand side of the screen. </p>

<p>I have tried to add the following piece of coding to resolve this issue:</p>

<pre><code>#wctopdropnav li{
float : right;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However another issue comes to light if I use the above stated coding. Although the tab does indeed appear on the right side of the screen, but the text/links for the other three tabs' dropdown menu options then also appear on the right side, but I would ideally want them to stay on the left side. Below I have included the entire navigation bar coding. </p>

 <p>I have following string which I have to sort using Radix sort:
1, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.2.2, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.3, 7.1.1, 7.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.3, 9.4, 4, 4.1, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 5.1.2, 5.3, 10, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2</p>

<p>I am using LSD based Radix sort and below are the result after every pass:</p>

<p><strong>After first pass:</strong>
1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 6.3, 7.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.3, 9.4, 4, 4.1, 4.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 5.3, 10, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 7.1.1, 3.2.2, 5.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5</p>

<p><strong>After second pass:</strong>
1, 4, 10, 4.1, 9.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 7.1.1, 5.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 3.2, 2.2, 9.2, 11.2, 11.2, 3.2.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 9.3, 9.3, 7.3, 2.3, 4.3, 4.3, 5.3, 6.3, 2.4, 9.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7</p>

<p><strong>After third pass:</strong>
1, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 3.2.2, 4, 4.3, 4.3, 4.1, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 4.4, 5.3, 5.1.2, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1, 6.3, 7.1.1, 7.3, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 10, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2, 11.2</p>

<p>As you can see the final sorted string is not correct. I am having hard time figuring out what am I missing. Or is the algorithm failing for this use case.</p>

<p>Guys, please guide!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT1: Putting the code</p>

<p>The code is in the native language(BML) og a CPQ tool (BigMachines)</p>

 My child was born outside the USA, and is possibly a USA citizen according to the rules. She has a UK passport she has travelled on within europe already.


Must my child travel on their USA passport ... I have to find a way to block porn sites on all browsers through something like iptables(concept) is there any way that I can do that.
 <p>I want to import data to many to many fields.</p>

<p>My code below imports the data, but only applies one relationship to the model (not two, as I've asked it to do below by importing it twice- where I wrote "cat = ...")</p>

<p>In my example below, I want it to import cat (category) from columns 4 & 11. My code below only applies one category to the model (not both).</p>

<p>How can I get it to apply both fields to the model? Im using python 2.7</p>

 <p>The question is as follows: <em>The Happyland Hospital is a monopsonist employer of nurses in the small city of Happyland. The market supply function of nurses is S(W) = 0.1W - 100, where W is the nurses weekly wage. What is the hospital's marginal expenditure, ME? If the hospital's marginal benefit of a nurse is $2,000 per week, no matter how many nurses it hires, what is the profit-maximizing number of nurses for the hospital to hire? What will the nurse's wage be? What is the deadweight loss?</em></p>

<p>And my work so far is as follows:</p>

<p>Qs = 0.01W - 100</p>

<p>0.01W = Q + 100</p>

<p>Inverse Supply: W = 100Q + 10,000</p>

<p>ME = W+(dW/dQ)Q = (10,000 + 100Q) + 100Q</p>

<p>ME = 10,000 + 200Q</p>

<p>Profit Maximization - MB = ME
10,000 + 200Q = 2000</p>

<p>I first derive the Inverse supply curve then use that to derive marginal revenue. Now I'm setting MB = ME as this is the profit maximizing point, but the Q it yields is negative. (-40). Have a feeling this is a problem point. Am I going wrong here? </p>
 <p>Suppose that the demand facing a monopoly firm is given by:
p=90-Q
a. If MQ = 1Q, determine the profit maximizing price and output levels
for the firm. Compute the Lerner index for this monopoly.
b. What price would you set if you wanted the firm to produce the
competitive quantity of output? If there are no fixed costs, what price and
output would you set if you wanted the firm to break even? Explain why
regulation of the competitive output can be done with a maximum price, whereas regulation of the break-even point can not be done through maximum price setting alone.
c. What is the welfare loss or deadweight loss of this monopoly? Illustrate
this loss in a clearly labeled diagram, and explain what total measure of
welfare you are using.</p>
 <p>I am new to Javascript and working on something where I retrieve data from mongodb and draw pia chart using high charts (www.highcharts.com). I am using AngularJS for client side, expressJS for server side with mongoose. I see that I am getting data from mongodb but it is not drawing pia charts correctly. Below is my html file and java script codes for controller, service, etc. I have even hardcoded response that I am getting from service into controller to make sure it has data the way it is expected but still it is not drawing chart as expected. </p>

<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Web page does display [["Positive",2],["Negative",5],["Nutral",69]] value when I try to display them so hard coded value on controller is there on scope but for some reason my directive is not loading correctly.</p>

<p>If I do below code directly without service or something, it works fine and it does draw entire pia-chart as expected but why it doesn't work when I use the same thing via services. As I mentioned, my service does work correctly and I see that it gets me exact that data I am expecting in the expected format as well (I have hard coded same thing here).</p>

... <p>This question isn't new here, but after reviewing existing posts I still need your advice.</p>

<p>If I need to "search" list data using a wildcard, I have to modify the XSL code.
A step-by-step instruction for doing it in SP2007 has been provided here: <a href="http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/q/23519/17591">Can I Filter a List/Data View using Contains instead of equals in SP2010?</a> >>> <a href="http://blog.philwicklund.com/fff/2009/04/using-the-data-view-web-part-to-search-a-sharepoint-list.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.philwicklund.com/fff/2009/04/using-the-data-view-web-part-to-search-a-sharepoint-list.html</a></p>

<p>I just tried to implement Phil's tips and got to the point 3 of his instructions, where I got stuck. All the previous steps could be applied to SP2010 with minor changes as for SP2007 version he refers to, but starting from this one I could not adapt Phil's tips for 2010 version. Could anyone kindly help?</p>

 <p>A popular channel on YouTube that I previously held in high regard recently published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg" rel="nofollow">a video</a>, where several surprising claims are made. I think I can sum the claims up as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Addictive chemicals in drugs are not the underlying reason for addiction. Addiction is actually caused by a sort of lack of 
"socialization", and when that socialization returns, the addiction
vanishes.
The example is given of troops, lacking in socialization and in a war zone, take to heroin, but suffer no addiction or withdrawal symptoms when returned to their homes.</li>
<li>Other things which can't possibly have a chemical effect (reddit and porn are examples given) cause addiction in much the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>The video then goes into that modern society has put socialization as a low priority, and that people have fewer friends, and that we need to "restructure our society".</p>

<p>Is this in any way accurate?</p>

Four months ago, I left my country of residence in the US to live in UK. I entered UK on my US passport which was stamped with a 6-month stay on it.

We would like to apply for Spouse visa so that she is able to find work with other companies (her present visa is issued for a specific employer and would have to be re-applied for if she were to find work for another employer).</p>

<p><strong>In depth reasoning:</strong>
If you leave the UK, you can claim your income tax back as you will not be remaining in the UK as a permanent resident. Before you are issued your UK passport, you are required to be living and working in the UK for 5 (or 6... not sure) years. If you leave, you get your tax back; if you choose to remain and apply for permanent residence, you can't.</p>

<p>Since my wife has been on her current visa (Tier 2 general) for its full duration (2 years), she could continue another 3 years and claim her passport. However, moving to a spouse visa causes this 'tally' to reset... meaning that she now has to build up her 5 years from year zero (as if she just arrived in the UK).</p>

<p>Since her 2 years on the Tier 2 General visa will not count toward her passport, we think that she can claim her income tax (otherwise those two years are simply lost and all the money she has paid in tax is for... nothing?!)</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
Are we able to claim an income tax refund?</p>

 <p>My plugs won't work in some parts of my house. But if I go up in the attic To a junction box . The only way  I can get the power to work in thoses places is to put a jumper from the  neutral to the  ground  and everything works fine. It's the  craziest thing I've ever seen. Ive done some research on this. Some old timers say they did this in the older houses. So that's what I've done. And all is good. But I can't quite thinking about it. Please help. </p>

<p>I found this while researching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a real electrician and on most of the older homes a jumper from nutruls went to ground. I been playing out here with you guys. Now i will answer your last question if you run under ground plastic pvc you dont want to use a ground rod. The way your main house panel is you can come back off the subpanel nutrals with a extra wire to all your grounds in garage or shed. You need to learn the old way was just as good as the new way.l just dont ground the box and yes it does work. And yes the inspector does not mess with me any more im hard headed. And his oulet is wrong the ground and nutral should be in box and seperate wires should go to outlet. The new thing today is they have a crazy made up idea that a seperate ground is safer for lightning bullshit all most all of the old houses are still standing or fell down from old age. When lighting strikes a main service it will go right back to ground rod. Not come back up the nutrals. Lighting does not ever take the long path on under ground power to your house if you have one hell of a run it blows out the power tranformer on pole and a small charge back the ground on the main handles it as far as it comming back a nother 150 feet plus will never happen to far of a path.you got a better chance of seeing god did it for thirty years and all my garages and sheds are still standing.over head is different change the new law every building over head needs a ground rod.</p>

<p>Is this true.</p>
 <p>I recently shipped a 300$ hardware keylogger from Amazon for spying purpuses and one day I planted in the computer's classroom. I targeted my professor who was teaching a difficult, but useless course. I have deleted the slides from the machine to force her to enter the login details from her mail or her blackboard live in class, so that she would download them.</p>

<p>I recovered the password from  keylogger, and there I had the her university email. I accessed everything:</p>

<ul>
<li>Staff emails</li>
<li>Finances</li>
<li>Previous exams </li>
<li>The transcripts of my friends.</li>
<li>Private emails </li>
<li>Id  and stuff</li>
<li>And most importantly, this semester's exams and quizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I once sent a message by mistake once so she noticed but changed her password. </p>

<p>Feeling like I saw some kind of James Bond, I pervaled. I targeted her gmail, hijacked it. Got her information and search history. She changed her password. I hijacked her Pearson account, and downloaded 30% testbanks using a python script (with mechanize) for the stuff. I still plan on leaking them online for free for the community once I scrap 100% of testbanks. Lazy professors (who make > 10,000$ a month from reading slides) need to learn to be original when making quizes.</p>

<p>Then, I went for the dropbox, this is where she kept our quiz. That day, she changed her dropbox password too, then I got mad. And I added her university email into a porn website since I was pissed. </p>

<p>The next day, she didn't come to class. I went to her office to ask her a question about our project (while acting normally and smiling) and I noticed her eyes were red. She was crying so bad, apparently. When I left the office,I felt like I was some kind of a monster. My conscience is torturing me. The teacher is so sweat, she's a well-bred researcher, a mother, and has a good soul. </p>

<p>How should I proceed? Please, don't tell me to come out to her, that means I get expelled if not worse, so this is out of the question. But I need a way to fix things since teacher seems depressed.</p>

 <p>I have my website similar to pastebin. There is a text box on the index.php and a captcha code to complete after you finish typing to upload the paste. If you enter the wrong code, as many do, including me, a new page comes up that says you mistyped, then when you go back to index.php then everything you have written in the text box gone? Isn't cookies or cache that can save this?</p>

<p>Here's an GIF showing what i mean.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xAGhQ.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xAGhQ.gif" alt="https://gyazo.com/4db14468e5ba74837e7b9c9db5715cf9"></a></p>

<p>I think this can be fixed using some kind of javascript or cookie, i don't know which one or anything?</p>

<p>Please help.</p>

<p>EDIT: Index.php </p>

 <p>So I have made a plugin for (Bukkit/Spigot) in Java and it ends up using up enough memory to crash the server with an Out of memory error.</p>

<p>So I added the "-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError" thing to the start script and waited for the crash dump. Once I got it, I got this hell of a file that is 8GB... If you REALLY want to download it, it is found here: <a href="https://img.parallaxmc.com/?dir=Porn" rel="nofollow">https://img.parallaxmc.com/?dir=Porn</a></p>

<p>Disregard the directory name, I work with some very immature people. Anyways, the class byte[] is taking up of 70% of my memory, as far as I can see. Here are some snapshots of the profiler:</p>

<p><a href="https://gyazo.com/0e14f6b4b082cf7d70fcb968d21007f7" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/0e14f6b4b082cf7d70fcb968d21007f7</a>
<a href="https://gyazo.com/d5c72c241364031b0c492d11d9ddefd5" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/d5c72c241364031b0c492d11d9ddefd5</a></p>

<p>I've noticed that my sql methods have been creating an issue, and have since fixed my methods. But I have no clue whats going on with that byte[] class. Is that normal?</p>
 A couple of weeks ago I got myself a pair of Nike tights to keep me warm while running during winter. And since I've been running in them, my right knee is hurting, to the point where even simple ... <p>I have my website similar to pastebin. There is a text box on the index.php and a captcha code to complete after you finish typing to upload the paste. If you enter the wrong code, as many do, including me, a new page comes up that says you mistyped, then when you go back to index.php then everything you have written in the text box gone? Isn't cookies or cache that can save this?</p>

<p>Here's an GIF image showing what i mean: <a href="https://gyazo.com/5c8ecde235370074977bfb646447c598" rel="nofollow">https://gyazo.com/5c8ecde235370074977bfb646447c598</a> Look, everything dissapears...</p>

<p>I think this can be fixed using some kind of javascript or cookie, i don't know which one or anything?</p>

<p>Please help.</p>

 We all know the limits of a married person.We all know the definition of cheating in Buddhism.

But Buddhism existed in a time Porn did not exist.

So if a married person watch porn is it cheating?
 For example, would a box of baking soda in a fridge lose weight as it absorbs odor? How long would it take to drop 100 g?
 <p>Following image is my hosting directory, .htaccess locations and more explanation. Please kindly have a look.</p>

<p>Image is here >>> <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/TRcrL.png" rel="nofollow">my hosting and sites directories</a></p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Somebody link to my blog and he accidently linked to <code>www.abc.com/blog%E2%80%8E</code> instead of <code>www.abc.com/blog/</code>. I beleive <code>%E2%80%8E</code> is the slash <code>/</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How to change <code>%E2%80%8E</code> to slash <code>/</code> using <code>.htaccess</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Informations:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>abc.com</code> has html files & one <code>.htaccess</code> file</p></li>
<li><p><code>abc.com/blog/</code> has running wordpress and another one <code>.htaccess</code> file</p></li>
<li><p>Normally working 301 redirect code in <code>abc.com/blog/</code> is <code>Redirect
301 /abc.com/blog/asdf /blog/</code> (but that format doesn't work for
<code>%E2%80%8E</code>)</p></li>

 <p>I've recently installed El Capitan. The other day I restarted my computer for the first time for a while, and now it doesn't boot. I restarted in verbose mode and can see that there's a kernel panic relating to com.eltima.SyncMate.kext. It seemed like that was probably an incompatible extension, so I took a copy of the kext and then deleted EltimaAsync.kext from /System/Library/Extensions.</p>

<p>Sadly, when I rebooted, the problem persisted with the same kernel panic. I've searched high and low for other references to "eltima" anywhere on the drive, but I haven't found anything that looks relevant. I'm wondering if perhaps the kext has been pre-compiled in somewhere. I don't know if it's relevant, but the drive in question is encrypted with FileVault.</p>

<p>Is there something I can do to properly disable this kext so I can get the computer to boot? If possible I'd really like to avoid having to start from a clean install, even though I do have a good backup.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
 <p>I'll start this question with example of the problem I'd like to solve.</p>

<p>I like to tag my apps by category: productivity, development, media, etc.  I like to tag my movies by genre: action, drama, porn, comedy, etc.<br>
I like to tag my personal documents by some other criteria: bills, medical, auto-related, etc.</p>

<p>All these tags end up in a big messy list.  So when I go to tag another app, I have to scan this list of items irrelevant to current context.  Applying "comedy" to apps is invalid action and, in perfect universe, would not be available.  </p>

<p>Is there a way to somehow define contexts where certain tags become available while the rest of them disappear?  Is there a way to organize the tags other than them all being in on big stupid system-wide global list?</p>

 <p>I've been trying to understand the skew I see when looking at the skew of SPX.  Here is a snapshot today from thinkorswim.  I understand why IV increases for ITM puts -- namely because there is a negative correlation between volatility and moves of the underlying.  But I don't understand why the OTM puts IV increase with strike or why the ITM calls IV increase with strike.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mNrq3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mNrq3.png" alt="Skew of SPX"></a></p>

<p>I've been studying the different models that give rise to skew.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Local volatility models (e.g. Derman papers)</p>

<ul>
<li>Riding on a Smile</li>
<li>Regimes of Volatility</li>
<li>The Local Volatility Surface</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="http://math.nyu.edu/~atm262/fall06/compmethods/a1/nimalinmoodley.pdf" rel="nofollow">Heston stochastic volatility model</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand the increased IV on the left, but it is not obvious to me how these models explain the right portion of the plot above. </p>

<p>The skew plots seem to say that volatility is inversely correlated with underlying moves <em>for a while</em>, but after a "big" move, that correlation (between volatility and underlying price) changes to positive.  Is that the correct interpretation?</p>
 This question is fairly specific to the shadow-haunted, torture-porn, evil Cenobite god worshiping country of Nidal in Paizo's world of Golarion, but could also apply to other "lawful evil nations" ... I recently received a spam email as follows:

From: Friend's name &lt;dglee222@knu.ac.kr&gt;

Subject: Fwd: healthy belly fat loss without starvation

To: Me &lt;myemail@optonline.net&gt;`

it's just ... <p>Myself and some friends are taking part in a weight loss challenge this year and I will be recording monthly weigh in's and body measurements.  I need to find a calculation which will work out the difference's in inches and pounds. </p>

<p>I have the item title in column B from row 10 down to Row 17.  The first one in Row 10 is weight which is calculated in pounds.</p>

<p>Then going across from Column C is the month starting with Jan ending in December in Column N.  </p>

<p>The total loss needs to be updated after every monthly entry into column O. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot post a picture of the table as I'm new to this group. </p>

<p>I've tried other formulaes suggested to people with similar problems but they don't work for me. </p>

<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Many Thanks
Helen</p>
 When calculating the incidence on producers and consumers using a demand and supply curve is dead weight loss a part of the incidence? I know that for example the producer's incidence is a rectangle ... <p>I'm trying to get a new page up containing a responsive table, using the code below.

 <p>I know this was stupid, so i dont need to be told that...here goes:
I was at work and thought i was on 4g network on my Android phone but after sending a number of nude pics via a social media app and gmail on my BYOD smartphone i realized i was logged in to the corporate wifi network. I freaked out, logged right off and factory reset my phone. I'm obvioualy very worried. I was an idiot and will NEVER do this again. What is the chance that they would pick up on the fact that this type of image was being transmitted over their network--of course they have the ability to figure this out, but is it likely? I wasnt on a porn site, so hopefully no IP address to tip them off to look into my usage any deeper. I work for a large company.</p>

<p>There are some URLs which easily can be parsed, and I've got the output, but there are URLs too which producates empty output like><br>

 <p>I want to strip the entire past mails to get the original mail body without any quotations using MailKit/MimeKit.
Getting the mails (via IMAP) is already done and working fine. But in case of a replying mail, the history of the written mails should be completely removed to get the original mail body by itself. The mainly used mail client is Outlook (customer), but also Thunderbird is in use of the support team.</p>

<p>I know, that there is question >>> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31460653/quote-original-message-in-a-reply-using-mailkit">Quote original message in a reply using mailkit</a>
But this solves only the part for building the mail body for a reply (with all existing messages as quotation) ...</p>

<p>This functionality would be used for a ticket system.</p>

<p>How would you folks handle the deletion of the quotation from outlook?
(And maybe a more Outlook behavior of adding the existing mails as a quotation)</p>

<p>Thank you so much.  :)</p>
 <p>I'm a native speaker, born and living in england, and widely read from modern books and many classics.</p>

<p>I've seen <strong>sth</strong> as an abbreviation of <strong>something</strong>, but only informally from those who have learned English as a second language.</p>

<p>I've seen this from Chinese and also those from eastern Europe.</p>

<p>I the late 1990's I asked one user where he learned the term and he reported that his language teacher taught that abbreviation as being current in the English speaking world.</p>

<p>When I first saw this on a computer forum I had to ask what it meant, as the obvious <strong>sexually transmitted herpes</strong> (derived from <strong>STD</strong>) did not fit the context.</p>

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>where and when did this abbreviation originate?</li>
<li>have you seen this used by native English speakers anywhere in the world? (particularly pre-internet age, ~1990)</li>
</ol>

 <p>at my university i had an exam and the last problem [so the most difficult part of it :)]<br></p>

<p><br>i have solved this exercise, the solution that i have made is available in the print screen that u can find bellow. so i would like to know what i have done wrong or correct, what i have to do to improve my ER diagram acording to the problem?<br></p>

<p>sound like this:</p>

<p>A health care centre is planning to manage its population of chronic disease patients using wearable electronic medical devices to monitor health parameters. The devices worn by a patient form a Personal Area Network1 (PAN), communicating through Continua2 protocols with a smart phone, which acts as a gateway to the medical centre. Most of the patients will only wear reading devices (sensors), to monitor health parameters, such as the heartbeat and glucose level, but some of the patients will also wear output devices (actuators), to control an insulin pump3 or set the speed on a VAD4 . Your task is to design the database of the medical centre to manage the collected readings and settings of monitored patient devices. <br></p>

<p>A more detailed description follows: <br></p>

<p>A medical device can be an input sensor (glucose meter), an actuator (insulin pump) or both. Every device has a serial number from its manufacturer and a description (e.g., “blood pressure meter” or “insulin pump+glucose meter”). Devices handle readings and writings of values of physical measures, such as glucose level (5.9 mmol/L), temperature (37.8 ºC), rotating speed (2000 RPM) or voltage (35 mV). These values and the times of observation/setting are to be recorded in the database. Actuators receive "settings" of values at specific times (e.g., setting the rotating speed of a pump to 2000 RPM). Sensors can collect “readings", sets of values at specific times. For instance, a device for measuring the heart rate could send the last 60 values sampled in the past hour to be stored on the database associated to the time of collecting that data from the sensor; in that case, an example reading would store the signal as 60 name-value pairs (“minute 00” : 75, “minute 01” : 78, … “minute 59” : 125) associated to "Wed Sep 30 23:58:29 WEST 2015”. Another case is a blood pressure meter which collects in each reading two name-value pairs (e.g., “min” : 7.2 and “max” : 13.8). <br></p>

<p>The wearable devices of a patient are connected to a patient's PAN. A given device is connected to one (and only one) PAN during a time period, but may be disconnected after some time (for instance, to be replaced or connected to the PAN of another patient), or even reconnected again (for instance, after a repair). <br></p>

<p>Patients who carry wearable devices have a PAN (in practice a smart phone, and no more than one PAN per patient!). The PAN is used to transfer data (readings and settings) between the wireless medical devices and the database in the medical centre. PANs, each identified by a unique internet domain name (“panXXX.healthunit.org”), have a mobile phone number. PANs are worn by patients over some periods (when prescribed), but a patient may replace a PAN for another PAN after some time (for instance, a given PAN that was used by a recovered patient may be assigned later to a new patient). <br></p>

<p>In the medical centre, we also keep track of the municipalities where each patient is living over different periods of time (“Joe lived in Cascais from 1-dec-2011 to 31-mar-2013 and in Lisbon since then”). We also keep track of the periods in which two patients have cohabitated (“Joe lived with Mary from 1-dec-2011 to 31-mar-2013 and has been living with Nicole since 30-apr-2014”). The database has the name, address and the (unique) National Health Service number of each patient: a municipality has a name and a unique 5 digit code (assigned by the National Bureau of Statistics). <br></p>

<p>Note: To encode periods that have not ended in the database, i.e., periods spanning from sometime ago to the present you could set the final date of the period to a special date, e.g. Dec 31st , 2999. For instance, to encode that a blood pressure device is connected to PAN pan99.healthunit.org since September 28th, 2015 until now, or a patient who moved to the municipality of Lisbon the same date, we would set the start and end dates of the relevant periods to “Mon Sep 28 00:00:00 WEST 2015” and “Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 WEST 2999”, respectively.</p>

 <p>This is the program which sets the cursor position to the x and y coordinates,thereby prints Hello , </p>

<pre><code>#include<dos.h>
main(){
union in,out;
in.h.ah=2;
in.h.dh=10;
in.h.dl=10;
int86(16,&in,&out);
printf("\nHello");
}
</code></pre>

<p>but in this service number is 2 which means it hides the mouse pointer.
And the interrupt number is 16 which i think is for video display.</p>

<p><strong><em>How this program is executed serially?</em></strong></p>

<p>What is the difference between that program and this following Program:</p>

<pre><code>  in.x.ax=1;
  int86(0x33,&in,&out);                        //execute interrupt to show mouse pointer.
  gotoxy(25,23);                                    //goto any random position on screen.
  printf("Press any key to exit...");
  while(!kbhit())                          
  {
     in.x.ax=3;                                                
     int86(0x33,&in,&out);
     gotoxy(2,2);                                           
     printf("(x,y)=(%d,%d)",out.x.cx,out.x.dx);

 I need help with my Gmail email on my Dell 1410, my Gmail is being compromised.

sound like this:
A health care centre is planning to manage its population of chronic disease patients using wearable electronic medical devices to monitor health parameters. The devices worn by a patient form a Personal Area Network1 (PAN), communicating through Continua2 protocols with a smart phone, which acts as a gateway to the medical centre. Most of the patients will only wear reading devices (sensors), to monitor health parameters, such as the heartbeat and glucose level, but some of the patients will also wear output devices (actuators), to control an insulin pump3 or set the speed on a VAD4 . Your task is to design the database of the medical centre to manage the collected readings and settings of monitored patient devices. 
A more detailed description follows: 
A medical device can be an input sensor (glucose meter), an actuator (insulin pump) or both. Every device has a serial number from its manufacturer and a description (e.g., “blood pressure meter” or “insulin pump+glucose meter”). Devices handle readings and writings of values of physical measures, such as glucose level (5.9 mmol/L), temperature (37.8 ºC), rotating speed (2000 RPM) or voltage (35 mV). These values and the times of observation/setting are to be recorded in the database. Actuators receive "settings" of values at specific times (e.g., setting the rotating speed of a pump to 2000 RPM). Sensors can collect “readings", sets of values at specific times. For instance, a device for measuring the heart rate could send the last 60 values sampled in the past hour to be stored on the database associated to the time of collecting that data from the sensor; in that case, an example reading would store the signal as 60 name-value pairs (“minute 00” : 75, “minute 01” : 78, … “minute 59” : 125) associated to "Wed Sep 30 23:58:29 WEST 2015”. Another case is a blood pressure meter which collects in each reading two name-value pairs (e.g., “min” : 7.2 and “max” : 13.8). 
The wearable devices of a patient are connected to a patient's PAN. A given device is connected to one (and only one) PAN during a time period, but may be disconnected after some time (for instance, to be replaced or connected to the PAN of another patient), or even reconnected again (for instance, after a repair). 
Patients who carry wearable devices have a PAN (in practice a smart phone, and no more than one PAN per patient!). The PAN is used to transfer data (readings and settings) between the wireless medical devices and the database in the medical centre. PANs, each identified by a unique internet domain name (“panXXX.healthunit.org”), have a mobile phone number. PANs are worn by patients over some periods (when prescribed), but a patient may replace a PAN for another PAN after some time (for instance, a given PAN that was used by a recovered patient may be assigned later to a new patient). 
In the medical centre, we also keep track of the municipalities where each patient is living over different periods of time (“Joe lived in Cascais from 1-dec-2011 to 31-mar-2013 and in Lisbon since then”). We also keep track of the periods in which two patients have cohabitated (“Joe lived with Mary from 1-dec-2011 to 31-mar-2013 and has been living with Nicole since 30-apr-2014”). The database has the name, address and the (unique) National Health Service number of each patient: a municipality has a name and a unique 5 digit code (assigned by the National Bureau of Statistics).

<p>This is an HTML form with results calculated using JavaScript.  My goal is to display a table of 2-6 columns and variable number of rows depending on user input (form would be modified).  My problem is that I am not fully understanding how to get the table created in JavaScript after the user clicks the Calculate button.  I have found some potential good answers but apparently don't fully understand it all.  Running the following code is somewhat like what I want my output to display.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.  Simpler is better due to my limited experience.  Thanks.</p>
 <p>I would like to know how to get the tab to act in unison with the icon within it when the pointer is hovering over it. I want what is blue to turn white and what is white to turn blue.</p>

<p>I want the icon to transform and be seen when I'm hovering over the tab.</p>

<p>Problem:
As of now, when the pointer enters the tab it completely turns blue, covering the icon. I have to hover over the icon itself for it to be shown.</p>

 NZT is a fictional compound in a movie called limitless, basically it's a brain booster, it gives access to more simultaneous neuron activity.
are there any real cognitive enhancers out there?

 <p>I hope this is the right SE for this question.  If not please point me in a better direction.  I'm working on a project that requires a counterweight in a tight/organic space.  I'm trying to maximize the weight so I need a dense material -- the denser the better.  A material that's easy to machine would be OK, but ideally something that could conform to the space would be better.</p>

<p>These requirements led me to consider lead shot or lead wool as an option.  My concern is obviously safety.  I'm wondering if it is safe to encapsulate the lead with something like epoxy.</p>

<p>My understanding is that lead poisoning typically arrises from ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact.  I imagine that if I encapsulate the lead in something like epoxy then those three pathways are no longer relevant, but I'm just not sure and would rather avoid taking chances.  Maybe the only risk is during the encapsulation process?  Clearly lead is used in a variety of applications with human contact (e.g. lead vests for x-ray) so there must be someway to properly shield it from the surrounding environment.</p>
 <p>If it is believed that only Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are the supreme gods, why do we worship other gods like Rama, Krishna, Sai baba etc</p>

<p>These days some people are saying that Sai baba is not a god, and some people are saying he is incarnation of Lord Shiva so instead of worshipping Sai, it is better to worship only Lord Shiva right?</p>

<p>I mean anyway as Sai is incarnation of Lord Shiva, if one worships only Lord Shiva, it reaches to Lord Sai baba also, am I wrong?</p>

<p>My question is if a person worships a human being believing(wrongly) him to be some god's incarnation, then he wont get mukti or moksha right?</p>

<pre><code>location ~* \.(ico|js|css|png|gif|jpe?g)$ {
  expires 7d;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which actually looks like what I need. The problem is, if I include this code into my into the NGINX.conf, no static files are delivered anymore and my site is blank. Any ideas/hints what might cause this result? Maybe I have to add, that the static files are distributed in different directories :/. My NGINX config file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>server {
  server_name               bla.domain.com;

  listen                    80;
  root                      /var/repo/;

  location / {
    default_type            text/html;
    index                   index.html;

    if ($request_method !~ ^(GET)$ ) {
      return 444;
    }

    if ($http_user_agent ~* LWP::Simple|BBBike|wget) {
      return 403;
    }

    if ( $http_referer ~* (babes|forsale|girl|jewelry|love|nudit|organic|poker|porn|sex|teen) ) {
      return 403;
    }
  }

  location /bf/football/ {

  }

  location /bf/f20/ {

  }

 More than 5 years ago, I watched a non-english movie online. It was in the erotic (not porn) section. Also it was probably from the 90s or earlier! I only watched half of it. It started with a guy ... Somebody in my family has come up positive for methamphetamine. I was wondering if it is possible to synthesize enough methamphetamine into a diet pill to cause somebody to not only come up positive ... I want a software on computer to block all the porn sites and sites and on which there is nudity and adult content. 
 <p>First off, I'm already resigned to the fact that I am a failure at soldering. (hours of research into dozens of website/youtube how-tos, 4 different soldering irons (albeit inexpensive), 9 or 10 different tips, fluctuating flux amounts, 3 different brands of solder, innumerable attempted techniques, 2 or 3 permanent tiny scars from sub-dermal blistering, and a small pile of charred electronics had, some months ago, broken my will and led to my surrender). But I'm still left with an unproven theory that others here might help confirm or reject. Being that, when faced with being placed onto a targeted location, the solder--after assuming a spherical shape--would, at times, refuse to separate from the iron's tip or, more often, flee the area, rolling the length of the workspace, around obstacles, up walls, or--I imagine--down entire city blocks until I would decide to break off the chase and simply create a whole new obstinate silvery blob, could it be that I had inadvertently magnetized the soldering tip by storing it next to a battery or some other atmospheric anomaly and thereby causing it to disrupt the normal soldering process and ultimately revealing it to be the cause of my circuitrous disability? While I eagerly await your replies I will click on the "unwanted magnetic induction" question to the right that I just now discovered. My gratitude to the team, --smf       </p>

<p>How could I make an IP address can be accessed by visitors like domain name ?. I got information from my server administrator. He told to me, I have to parked my an IP address such as parked a domain name. But I do not know, what is term for that ?.</p>

<p>Indonesia country has blocked many websites such as vimeo.com and other website. Not only that, in my country also blocks "Public DNS" such as Google Public DNS like this <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/</a> and you definitely know it.</p>

<p>My country is very extreme for blocks a website. You definitely know about my country had very extreme laws or very extreme constitutions such as censor or blur on local TV, porn laws, etc. Almost the same like ISIS laws or other terrorist laws. Maybe parliament in my country has controlled by terrorist or for corruption with many reasons like blocks a website. You definitely know that.</p>

<p>Therefore, many websites use a specifically IP address for visitors to avoid censor. So, visitors do not need PPTP VPN, other VPN or Proxy to unblock a website. They can be directly to a website which is blocked without domain name. But I do not know, what is term for that ?.</p>

<p>Do you know term for that ?.</p>

 I know this is extremely convoluted but  it has been bugging me all night. I remember learning of the word (or phrase) in something similar to a "Word porn" post. I remember it was a very strange ... <p>all. 
I am currently in my second year of my full-time master's clinical mental health counseling course and feel very behind. I also currently work full time as a mental health case manager in a local organization and am married. 
Over the last two semesters (and summer semester was 4 intense weeks of three classes), I have now obtained a C and will have to repeat the summer course to be able to obtain licensure in Ohio. So, this is one course to add on to the end so I can get licensure later. Because of the intensive counseling work we are already doing in addition to starting my practicum next semester, I feel like I am falling behind. I want to be getting A's- or at least B's- and I doing just well enough to pass. I'm about halfway through the semester and already looking at two 85's or lower right now. 
I have a plan, but how do i get back on track? I want to start next semester with a good start, even if it is part-time, and do not want to have to repeat any courses from this semester. I am currently in diagnosis, at-risk populations, and techniques in addition to working full-time, maintaining a marriage, social life, and attempting to lose weight. 
I have so much on my plate, making attempts to organize it, and just have no idea how i will get it all done. 
I cannot leave my job! I also recently got over a bout of a depressive episode and stopped seeing my therapist who i saw for two sessions- i chose to stop seeing her for a reason. 
Please, any suggestions would be appreciated. Any suggestions for my writing, or clarifications, would be helpful. I am happy to send any of my writing for your critique. (normally, I would capitalize all my I's). 
Thank you for your time and help,

 The E-M procedure appears, to the uninitiated, as more or less black magic. Estimate parameters of an HMM (for example) using supervised data. Then decode untagged data, using forward-backward to ... <p>Having the following table:</p>

5           NIKE        1       10
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>codpers     nike    nike_num    nike_total  adidas  adidas_num  adidas_total

 left join aa_lc_pp.xx ADIDAS on p.codpers = ACNUR.codpers and ADIDAS.cat = 'ADIDAS'
group by p.codpers
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I will have more than 100 categories so wouldn't be effective at all to make 100 joins. That's why I wanted to use a pivot table</p>

<p>From what I know, with mysql I could get using the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT    codpers,   SUM(cat='NIKE') > 0 AS NIKE,   SUM(num * (cat='NIKE')) AS NIKE_num,   SUM(total * (cat='NIKE')) AS NIKE_total   SUM(cat='ADIDAS') > 0 AS ADIDAS,   SUM(num * (cat='ADIDAS')) AS ADIDAS_num,   SUM(total * (cat='ADIDAS')) AS ADIDAS_total FROM xx  GROUP BY codpers;

 What would be the implications on the society of sperm banks provided the sperm of celebrities, scientists, actors, porn stars, musicians, heroes for money to the customers while paying the royalties ... <p>I am currently implementing a Facebook Fitness sharing feature and I would like to have a custom unit just like what nike do:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOBfy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOBfy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>I have hosted my own unit object and implemented the share button using the following code:</p>

<pre><code> iv_workout_share.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {

                    // Create an object

                    .putString("og:type", "fitness.course")

                    .putString("fitness:custom_unit_energy:value", 100 + "")
                    .putString("fitness:custom_unit_energy:units", "http://example.com/fatburn.html");


            for (int i = 0; i < workout.location_record.size(); i++) {

                object.putDouble("fitness:metrics[" + i + "]:location:latitude", workout.location_record.get(i).getLat());
                object.putDouble("fitness:metrics["+i+"]:location:longitude",workout.location_record.get(i).getLong());

                    }
                }
            }

            // Create an action
            ShareOpenGraphAction action = new ShareOpenGraphAction.Builder()
                    .setActionType("fitness.runs")
                    .putObject("course", object.build())

<p>And when I click the share button, the Facebook share dialog pop up and I press the post button, a toast pop up telling me that the post is shared.</p>

 <p>I would like to build application using django and drf as a backend and angularJS for frontend.</p>

<p>I have three choices</p>

<ol>
<li>django generate 1 template view eg '/' and later angular do routing (single
app) - like in this tutorial
<a href="https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial#learning-django-and-angularjs" rel="nofollow">https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial#learning-django-and-angularjs</a></li>
<li>django generates all urls. Angular is used for creating components(application) and use it in selected django templates. Angular route is not used.</li>
<li>use django-angular: <a href="http://django-angular.readthedocs.org/en" rel="nofollow">http://django-angular.readthedocs.org/en</a> (I didn't use it yet so I am not sure if it's the same as 2.)</li>
</ol>

<p>User experience is important for me. Application would have few widgets (for example creating diet plan, calendar). Also I would like to use django-allauth. 
What option is the most common/best in your opinion ?</p>
 <p>in java we can get the highlighted text from native window by using JNA or JNI for example using piece of code >>><br>

<br><br>is there any way to do the samething by using android SDK??</p>
 <p>I have a table that is 30 rows long in a column. Every day I enter my weight. So day 1 I entered my weight into A1, day 2 into A2 and so on. </p>

<p>Now I want to calculate some things based off of this, such as show "Current weight:", "Current BMI:", "Projected weight loss:" and so on. But to do that, I need to use the latest entered value. I have another row, called "Date" that shows the date next to each weight input. So right now I have 30 dates because my table is 30 rows long but only 2 weight values since I made the sheet yesterday. </p>

<p>So my question is: how do I pick the weight that is next to the date that is equal to today's date for when I want to use it in a formula?</p>

 <p>Can you teach a class (and charge for it) based on a book that someone else has written. For example, could teach a class on "The Lean Startup?" What if I used the principle of the book and connected to a "self-help" course on weight-loss, etc, and called it something like: The Lean Startup for Swift Weight Loss (yes, a poor name - purely hypothetical."</p>

<p>In essence: could I do the above, and charge for it, without infringing on brand, copyright, etc.? Do I need to get permission from the authors if I credit them with the "principle?"</p>

<p>When I click any taxonomy ex: Clinic in primary nav , I get the loaded taxonomy details using</p>

<pre><code>get_term_by( 'slug', get_query_var( 'term' ), get_query_var( 'taxonomy' )   );
</code></pre>

<p>its working fine.
<strong>Now my questions is</strong>
I cant get the post type in the loaded term</p>

<p>i use get_post_type() its  not worked 
then how can i get post type for loaded term?</p>
 <p>My problem is quite simple. I am hoping someone can diagnosis what must be going on.</p>

<p>Every night, long after my parents go to sleep, Google appears to go offline. This usually happens between 12 and 3 am. after 3 am it is fine. No, it is not from watching porn -- I use my tablet for that, and this happens on all my devices.</p>

<p>This is the error message I receive 
URL i am trying to access: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=why+is+this+happening+to+me&btnG=Google+Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=why+is+this+happening+to+me&btnG=Google+Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=</a></p>

<p>Result on my screen:</p>

<p>I am using Google Chrome and have a Linksys router.  No other websites appear to be effected except Google. The error message I receive is unlike any other error message I have ever seen Chrome produce -- in other words, it <strong>does not</strong> say anything like "HTTP 400 bad request", or show a picture of a dinosuar and say "No internet connection!", or even say something like "BAD DNS PROE". All it says is what I've listed and this ambiguous reference number, which I have no idea what it is referring to.</p>

<p>Side note: This forces me to use Bing, which, despite what the commercials tell you, is TERRIBLE!! When I run searches for things like "how to do (something) in C programming language" it gives me results for C#, C++ --- unacceptable. </p>

<p>1) Why is this happening? Is someone trying to read my Google searches?</p>

<p>2) How can I make it stop?</p>
 <p>On the following page, the side-by-side content in the "PORTFOLIO ATTRIBUTES" tab at the bottom of the page renders just fine on desktop browsers, but when you view the chart side-by-side with the table on a mobile browser, they end up overlapping and one item gets cut off:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realitysharesadvisors.com/indexes/divcon-leaders/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realitysharesadvisors.com/indexes/divcon-leaders/</a></p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to keep them side-by-side and responsive on mobile-sized browser windows as well?  The chart and table at the top of the page seem to render just fine and stay side-by-side on mobile browsers.  Thanks.</p>

 <p>I am currently implementing a Facebook Fitness sharing feature and I would like to have a custom unit just like what nike do:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOBfy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOBfy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>I have hosted my own unit object and implemented the share button using the following code:</p>

 <p>What is “the Pounds 100m revamp”?</p>

<p>Edit: My question is specific as hell, how is it even possible to think that a question is asked about a part of the whole phrase enclosed in quotation marks? No comments...</p>

<p>Quotation from the comment section answering my question: "...Actually, this is a quotation from one of the FT articles: ft.com/cms/s/1/6b53e8d4-7b8c-11d9-9af4-00000e2511c8.html However, I have a printed copy of it, so it seems that "the £100m revamp" turned into "the Pounds 100m revamp" during the process of printing."</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was Band Aid. Then there was Sport Aid, Farm Aid and Net Aid. And now, 20 years after Sir Bob Geldof and a bunch of big-haired pop stars urged us to "Feed the World", there is a music album released by Manager Aid. </p>

<p>The managers in question hail from John Lewis, the privately run British retailer. The worthwhile cause in question is Whizz Kidz, a charity dedicated to helping "non-mobile children". And the record in question is entitled New Shop On the Block. </p>

<p>It makes for harrowing listening. Not because two of the 10 tracks are about disabled children. But because eight of them - from the desperately chirpy Chelsea, to the mess of faux Caribbean music that is Smile - are atrocious corporate anthems. </p>

<p>Track four, The JLP Rap, is probably the lowest point of the many low points, including as it does, the following couplets: </p>

<p>"DM, SM, NMP </p>

<p>We speak in letters as you see </p>

<p>From 001 to 045 </p>

<p>It's pounds in the till that keep us </p>

<p>alive". </p>

<p>What on earth, you may wonder, possessed 58 British managers to record, perform and release such an album? Answer: they were given the task of composing, arranging, producing and recording the LP as part of a team-building exercise, the aim of which was to bond them in a "powerful collective experience". </p>

<p>I received my copy of New Shop On the Block while strolling around the World of Learning gathering at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, "the UK's key conference and exhibition for business learning". As he gave me the CD, the man from the training company that organised this "Face the Music" exercise for John Lewis remarked that the task had "created one of the most highly bonded teams" he had ever come across. </p>

<p>It was, he said, a brilliant way for them to commemorate the £100m revamp of their Peter Jones department store on London's Sloane Square. It was also "very deep" in terms of the changes it made in them. "The MD involved in the project was crying by the end," he explained. </p>

<p>A couple of hours later, when I played the CD for the first time, I understood exactly what he meant. The record made me want to weep too. And it wasn't just the awfulness of the music that upset me. It was also the fact that "Face the Music" marked a worrying trend in team-building exercises. Before I explain, some context. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, team-building exercises didn't exist. People just came to work and bonded by "working and getting along with each other". Sometimes they would "go for a drink after work", "play football on Saturday" or "go for dinner at the weekend". But, generally speaking, team-building was a casual, natural, informal thing. </p>

<p>Then, in the 1980s, the business world decided that the only way of establishing a rapport between colleagues was by getting them to do group activities together - preferably on weekends, preferably outdoors and preferably in the rain. Sometimes referred to as "experiential learning", the idea was that workers would become immersed in an activity, learn new skills together and become closer-knit as a result. </p>

<p>A search through the cuttings shows that, over time, businesses have asked employees to participate in every group activity under the sun in the name of team-building: paintballing, mountain climbing, Porsche racing, sailing, kendo, horse whispering, clowning, treasure hunting, potholing, go-karting, cookery, international folk dancing, chicken herding, belly dancing, totem pole carving, wine blending - and, my own favourite, motorised toilet-bowl racing. </p>

<p>Judging from what I saw at the NEC, such exercises are as popular as ever: exhibitors were offering team-building courses in everything from yachting to truffle-hunting. When I saw a sign for the "Adult Learning Inspectorate", I thought, for a brief but horrible moment, that even the porn industry was getting in on the act. (Incredibly, I have since discovered that this has actually happened: Hustler TV, a digital channel, is encouraging companies to make porn films as a team-building exercise.) </p>

<p>While such exercises are generally useless, as most take place behind closed doors or in the middle of nowhere, they are also mostly harmless (although a few do go disastrously wrong: who can forget the story of staff at Eagle Star life insurance who were sufficiently motivated by a day-long fire-walking course that they agreed to walk barefoot over hot coals and ended up in hospital as a result? </p>

<p>However, exercises such as "Face the Music" and "Curtain Up!" - another team-building exercise offered by the same training company, in which colleagues perform in front of a live crowd - represent something new and ominous. Unlike paintballing and motorised toilet bowl racing, these "multi-sensory experiences", as they are described, require an audience. </p>

<p>And if there is one thing more excruciating than being involved in a team-building exercise, it is watching or enduring someone else's team-building exercise. I speak from experience, having listened to New Shop On the Block three times. </p>

<p>John Lewis may defend the release of its atrocious album by saying it will raise money for a good cause. And the charity element is certainly a mitigating factor. But I suspect that the people who have heard it would give even more generously if their donations meant they would never have to listen to New Shop on the Block ever again."</p>

 <p>I have been trying to bind my android multiform data to the play framework form binding. But right now its seems to be complaining that the <strong>Date format binding</strong> failed. Any help would be really greatly appreciated! </p>

 This is a hypothetical example but the idea is identical to the analysis I want to run. Imagine I’m exploring how diet and exercise influence weight loss. I have two factors: Diet (Yes/No) and ... I'm short 5'2" and 112kgs. I've been working to lose weight and have come down 5 st so far. Now I really want to ramp up my exercise and was looking at cycling as an option.

I've tried looking on ... <p>can someone please help me how to fix this code. What I need is to let the current time compare it to the nearest saved schedule in the column "from"</p>

 <p>I have a vps with ubuntu 14.04 LTS and i'm having trouble with uwsgi+nginx+django, the uwsgi is reporting in the log "bind(): Address already in use [core/socket.c line 763]" For what i searched in the web this error is the case of two applications linked uwsgi running in in the same socket, but has you can see in my configuration of nginx there's only one app. And need some help, i can't start my app with this configuration, and gives me 502 Gateway error. I started from scratch several times the configuration and it gives me always the same problem.</p>

<p>I've used in the past uwsgi with nginx and had no problem like this, the answer's i get from the internet say's that this is a problem of two applications running in the same socket but it's not the case in here as you can see in the nginx configuration file nginx.conf. And when i restart the service with the command sudo service uwsgi restart it gives me the output :</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo service uwsgi restart
stop: Unknown instance: 
uwsgi start/running, process 1877

<p>I installed uwsgi with the following commands :</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install uwsgi
$ sudo apt-get install uwsgi-plugin-python3
$ sudo apt-get install uwsgi-plugin-python
</code></pre>

<p>And the virtualenviroment was executed with :</p>

<pre><code>$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 sup.epa

<p>My uwsgi runs in emperor mode with the script :</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

<p>Does anyone know how to do this ?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot ;)</p>
 <p>I read it a long time ago, and it might even be a part of a longer book.
The premise are these two guys that are childhood friends.  The uke thinks that the other one has a good voice so he should go for voice acting or something eventually-- I just remember there's one part where he tells him, "No Osaka accent."
The seme ends up trying to date a girl (I think the uke said he wouldn't mind-- though they aren't dating at this point.  Still just friends.)  And he ends up dating this girl who's like the sister of some gang leader from another high school, or something?
I remember it being kinda weird because the main couple were very much thug-delinquent types.  There was even a bit where I'm pretty sure some little neighborhood kids were trying to sell them porn mags.  (There was this trio of little bratty boys who were acting far too old.)
But it was really good and really cute and now I can't find it no matter where I look.  Help, please! D:</p>

<p>The history behind this question is the following.

<p>tried many forums & third party packages too but their isn't any way out from this problem.
Thanks for your time</p>
 <p>I'm doing category sidebar template for online shop. I will use that in 2 places - on customer, and admin side. Each one will have own service of clicking on category. I want to pass parameter "redirect" which will decide what action will be done, but the problem is, that parameter isn't visible in nested templates - only in 1st level categories.</p>

<p>HTML :</p>

<pre><code><template name="categoriesSidebar">
    <ul>
        {{#each mainCategories}}
            <li>
                {{> categoriesSidebarItem redirect=true data=this }}
            </li>
        {{/each}}
    </ul>
</template>
<template name="categoriesSidebarItem">
    <a href="#">
        {{data.name}}
    </a>
    {{#if data.subCategories.length}}
        <ul>
            {{#each subCats }}
                <li>
                    {{> categoriesSidebarItem redirect=redirect data=this }}
                </li>
             {{/each}}
        </ul>
    {{/if}}
</template>
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript :</p>

<pre><code>Template.categoriesSidebar.helpers({
    mainCategories:  function() {
    return Categories.find({'categoryLevel' : 1});
  }
});

Template.categoriesSidebarItem.helpers({
    subCats : function(){
        return Categories.find({_id:{$in: this.data.subCategories}});
    }
});

Template.categoriesSidebarItem.events({
    'click a' : function(event){
        if(this.redirect == true){
            Router.go('category',{_id : this.data._id});
            return false;
        }else{
            //categoryId is ReactiveVar used in another template
            categoryId.set(this.category._id);
        }
    }
})
</code></pre>

<p>Result :</p>

<pre><code>Women
    Nike
Men
    Nike
    Adidas
</code></pre>

<p>Women and Men category work well , after clicking on them, "redirect" is seen as true and Router redirects to desired route, but for nested categories, "redirect" parameter is undefined.</p>

<p>How to pass that parameter to nested template ?</p>

<p>Suppose for example that I have a string of text such as:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = ["shirt","pants","shoes","tie","jacket"]
</code></pre>

<p>And I also have a list of brands that I have made into dictionary using the dict() function:</p>

<pre><code>shirt   Zara
shirt   GAP
shirt   Old Navy
shirt   Banana_Republic
shoes   Banana_Republic
shoes   Zenga
shoes   Zara
shoes   Nike
shoes   Adidas
tie     Hermes
tie     Ferragamo
tie     Alfani
jacket  Alfani
jacket  Under_Armour
jacket  Nike
jacket  Polo
jacket  The_North_Face
</code></pre>

<p>I need my function to return a list of common brands (any two commonalities) in which a given brand does at least two of the categories in my original list.
So for:
    mylist = ['shirt','shoes','tie','jacket']</p>

<pre><code>someFunction(mylist)
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>[‘Zara’,’Banana_Republic’,’Alfani’,’Nike’]
</code></pre>

<p>At first I tried writing a forloop which essentially does:</p>

<pre><code>brandDictionary = dict(brands)

def mappings(list, dictionary):
for category in list:
    return dictionary[category]
</code></pre>

<p>But this returns just one value and I need the string of values</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>mappings(mylist, brandDictionary)
</code></pre>

<p>Gives me:</p>

<pre><code>['Banana_Republic']
</code></pre>

<p>And NOT the full list I'm looking for.</p>

 An article appeared in USA Today:


  A 'brain power' pill may not be not too far from reality
  Limitless, a TV show airing on CBS this fall, features a pill that dramatically boosts the lead ... <p>I am meeting with an advisor - someone who means a lot to me - who will offer me advice on academia (such as what academic field to pursue etc). Presumably, he expects me to share any past experience that may influence our discussion.</p>

<p>There is a topic I want to bring up with him which I think will have a big impact how he advises academically.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I want to bring up the fact that I've published a diet book in the past.</p>

<p>The thing is my advisor is morbidly obese / overweight - will he take offense if I bring up the subject?</p>

<p>Note: I'd like to show him my experience (and capabilities) which he would never know if hadn't brought up the subject. Knowing this will certainly influence his decision. For example, he may direct me to take up something related to diet/weight loss or even writing (like journalism).</p>

<p>While I'm positive this will influence his decision, I am also concerned it may offend him. </p>

<p>Is it legitimate to be worried? And if not, what is the best way to bring up the subject without making him feel self-conscious? I was thinking of just saying I published a book on "health" without revealing it is specifically a diet book (among other things). And if he requests more information, let it be. Or if he asks me for the name of the book and decides to look up more information online on his own this is his choice, not mine. Is this rude?</p>

<p>P.S</p>

<p>He is not getting paid for his services. He is doing it as a favor. And I  cannot simply find a different adviser.</p>

<p>Pls keep in mind, I have no inclination to discuss "his" weight. But just speaking about the issue may make him feel awkward. I cannot afford to make him feel this way..  </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

 <p>When I invoke a CGI script (GET request) using either Chrome or Firefox, I noticed in the Apache access log that quite a few seconds later a HEAD request and a GET request with the same URI were being generated.  To make sure it was not a peculiarity of my Apache setup, I wrote a simple Perl script and installed it on my ISP's website.  This script simply does it's own logging to a disk file every time it is invoked of the time, the URI, the user agent, the remote address and port:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -wT
use strict;
use CGI;

my $cgi = new CGI;
print $cgi->header(-type=>'text/plain', -expires=>'-1d');
print "hello";

open (LOG, ">>printenv2.txt");
my ($sec, $min, $hr, $day, $mon, $year) = localtime;
my $timestamp = sprintf("%02d/%02d/%04d %02d:%02d:%02d", $mon + 1, $day, 1900 + $year, $hr, $min, $sec);
print LOG $timestamp, "\n";
my @keys = qw(REQUEST_METHOD REQUEST_URI HTTP_USER_AGENT REMOTE_ADDR REMOTE_PORT);
foreach (@keys) {
    print LOG "$_ = $ENV{$_}\n";
}
print LOG "\n";
close LOG;
</code></pre>

<p>I invoked the script once with <a href="http://localhost/friends/forms/cgi/printenv2/cgi" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/friends/forms/cgi/printenv2/cgi</a></p>

<p>The script was run three times, however, the last two runs occurred more than 14 seconds after my initial invocation.  Here is the output of the log:</p>

<p>As you can see the user agent associated with the two spurious invocations is different.  I ran SpyHunter to see if I had a virus.  I tried disabling all extensions.  I tried un-installng and re-installing Chrome.  Nothing helps.  This only occurs with Chrome and Firefox - the problem does not appear with Internet Explorer.</p>

 <p>I have the following code which queries two databases (same schema, tied to the same application). One db holds service information, and the other transactions related to the service. The select is run in the transaction db. The output until "Volume of files/messages" is correct, but the select after that is returning a standalone value and not taking into consideration the main select. What is a workaround or the correct way to achieve the same for query 3 as it applies to the main select. I have included the output too. Thanks.</p>

 Is there a way to ban porn websites, a country blocks access to porn website based on the ip address the person still access porn websites by proxy like "tor browser" "Psiphon" browser plugins ... <p>I am trying to delete my cover photo from my facebook timeline through graph api. I use >>> <a href="https://graph.facebook.com/photoid?method=delete&access_token=(Android" rel="nofollow">https://graph.facebook.com/photoid?method=delete&access_token=(Android</a> access token) . But i am getting error validiating ("Error validating access token: The session has been invalidated because the user has changed the password or because auth.expireSession was called.") </p>

<p>I double checked my access token expiration. from debug tool and its look like access token is fine. </p>

<p>Please tell me what can i do now to delete cover photo or any photo from my photos with the help of graph api access token.</p>

 <p>I have a div on an HTML page, which has nothing more than a JS generate form. Not my code, I'm updating for someone. For the mobile portion of the code, I need to put the form in a place on the page, where when the form expands down to go to the next option, all content below it would adjust its position accordingly. The current version of the code shows it overlapping the content rather than "pushing" it down.</p>

<p>See code below and thank you in advanced:</p>

 Has there been any concrete information about the legality of Bitcoin in any country?

Since any information can be injected into the blockchain, then if child porn / copyrighted material is injected ... <p>I have a div on an HTML page, which has nothing more than a JS generate form. Not my code, I'm updating for someone. For the mobile portion of the code, I need to put the form in a place on the page, where when the form expands down to go to the next option, all content below it would adjust its position accordingly. The current version of the code shows it overlapping the content rather than "pushing" it down.</p>

<p>See code below and thank you in advanced:</p>

 When your body burns calories and you lose weight, obviously mass is leaving your body.  In what form does it leave?  In other words, what is the physical process by which the body loses weight when ... Is there any way to get automatic row numbers in table?

... <p>Has anyone one gotten Win 7, Verizon Ellipsis 8 to work with USB debugging. 
 - Talked with 2 different people at level 2 support at Verizon. 
   Both no help though they tried. 1st pointed to Google/Android and gave me
   a support number there.
 - Google says Verizon's fault due to modified/customized OS. They even
   tried to point to hardware manufacturer 
 - Verizon "Store" guy did some research and finally said, sorry this tablet
   won't support USB debugging. However, this LG will (so the web page(s)
   he was looking at said).</p>

<p>I can get table to connect at CD Rom but there are no drivers to be found on tablet. The store guy suggested I "Root" the tablet but said if I break it, no support. Great. And he didn't have any faith in that either.</p>

<p>Device driver will ONLY show USB as a QTAQZ3... and there is even a minor conflict between portable device and USB device.</p>

<p>Has anyone managed to get the Verizon Ellipsis 8 to work? Somewhere I read that someone had/has the Ellipsis 7 working.... </p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

 <p>Im making a weight loss app that saves how much you weight each day. I need to know how to save the weight for the current date and then making the text field empty for the next day.

Can someone point me in the right direction. Thanks!</p>

 Every google search result on Nike's slogan "Just do it" points to random articles claiming that the slogan came from the execution of killer Gary Gilmore, whose last words were "Let's do it".


  The ... <p><em>The technical solution can be found here</em>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/548355/entire-website-hijacked-part-2-how-to-configure-virtual-hosting">Entire website hijacked! Part 2: How to configure name-based virtual hosting?</a>
<hr /></p>

<p>The original domain is <a href="http://neteditr.com" rel="nofollow">http://neteditr.com</a></p>

<p>The offending copycat site is <a href="http://kitchen.co.jp" rel="nofollow">http://kitchen.co.jp</a></p>

<p>After reading upon some articles it seems like this kind of website hijacking is done by proxy servers, but how in the world is the link to "neteditr.com" removed from Google's search pages and theirs "kitchen.co.jp" is high up on the list? About a month ago, I could still do a "neteditr" search and have neteditr.com come up on 1st place.</p>

<p>As of now, I've used Google's SearchWiki to remove all of their entries and added the original URL hoping to give more weight back to the original domain. But this is only for my own Google account. If I do a generic search without being logged in, the problem still persists.</p>

<p>Anyhow my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technically, how do you prevent your website from being mirrored on another domain, I'm using Apache and serving HTML/JS/PHP/CSS files.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Short Answer: You can't prevent it</em></p>

<ol>
<li>What do you do if you are currently mirrored?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Short Answer: Set up name-based virtual hosting. See techinical solution above.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Google deleted your original domain from their search rank and has ranked your offender's site on Google's first page. Can we[victims] complain to Google about this?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Answer: After name-based virtual hosting is set up and the offending domain is disallowed HTTP access, given time Google should automatically remove their domain name</em></p>

<p>***EDIT</p>

<p>Using stackoverflow.com as an example:</p>

<p>stackoverflow.com IP = 69.59.196.211</p>

<p>It would be the same as registering a domain named stackunderflow.com and pointing it to 69.59.196.211. And while doing a search for stackoverflow in Google, stackunderflow.com is on Google's first page and stackoverflow.com is nowhere to be found. How did they do this?</p>

<p>***EDIT 2</p>

<p>After learning kitchen.go.jp is pointing to my original IP I've concluded that the offender is not using a proxy server. Usually in malevolent mirroring cases, the offender will add their own ads and porn links on top of the mirrored content. Such is not the case in my situation. So it could be either:</p>

<p>A) To be honest I think someone just wanted to have your editor on a Japanese domain (company webfilter policy maybe?), nothing malvolent -DrJokepu</p>

<p>B) Could be someone wanting to build search engine rank before switching it out to different content (i.e. theirs) -Roland Shaw</p>
 <p>I'm using Select2 Ajax to apply autocomplete on my html select </p>

                }
            });
        });
    </script>
</code></pre>

<p>and this is my html : </p>

<pre><code>    <select class="form-control input-sm marques-multi" name="marque"></select>
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what the URL : "user/marques" with the data (www.mywebsite.com/user/marques/marques?term=nike) returns :</p>

<pre><code>[
{"id_marque":"50670","marque_name":"NIK HUBER GUITARS"},{"id_marque":"50671","marque_name":"NIKALAS CATLOW"},{"id_marque":"1","marque_name":"NIKE"},{"id_marque":"50672","marque_name":"NIKE"},

]

<p>when I write as example nik in the select input i see in the console that the requests returns this json bellow with no errors but the select doesn't get fill with this data it stays blank.</p>

All the previous steps could be applied to SP2010 with minor changes as for SP2007 version he refers to, but starting from this one I could not adapt Phil's tips for 2010 version. Could anyone kindly help?</p>

  <p>3.Lastly we need to edit the rows query that the Data View uses. In the Code view, search for name="Rows". Notice the select on that
  variable contains a query – this is what we need to modify. By default
  it brings back all rows, but we need filter out the rows that do not
  match our search term.</p>

 <p>I need to retrieve the list of friends who have visited a particular place using graph api javascript sdk.</p>

<p>For example: Sam, Nike and 7 others have been to this place.</p>

<p>Is there any API call which I can use for this?</p>
 <p>Hi I am trying to create a CSV table  of stocks that will look like this (the numbers are set to be the same for the sake of simplicity):</p>

<pre><code> symbol    ev_ebitda    asset
 msft      40           60
 cvx       40           60
 baba      40           60
</code></pre>

<p>I have a list of stock symbols (which will be expanded at a later point in time):</p>

<pre><code>symbol = ["msft", "cvx", "baba"]
</code></pre>

<p>I created a dictionary for each symbol with <code>'symbol'</code>,<code>'ev_ebitda'</code>, and <code>'asset'</code>as keys:</p>

<pre><code>i=0
while i <len(symbol): 
    vars()[symbol[i]] = {}
    vars()[symbol[i]]['symbol']=symbol[i]
    vars()[symbol[i]]['ev_ebitda'] = 40
    vars()[symbol[i]]['asset'] = 60
    i +=1
</code></pre>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>cvx = {'asset': 60, 'ev_ebitda': 40, 'symbol': 'cvx'}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I attempted to output the table with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>header = ["symbol","ev_ebitda","asset"]
f = open('output.csv', 'wb')
w =csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames = header)
w.writeheader()
w.writerow() #not sure what to put in here 
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure how to write multiple rows from multiple dictionaries.  I tried following the the methods from this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22273970/writing-multiple-python-dictionaries-to-csv-file">discussion</a>, but had no success.  I have been trying to solve the problem the past 8 hours and would much appreciate your help! Here is my complete code:</p>

<pre><code>import csv

symbol = ["msft", "cvx", "baba"]
header = ["symbol","ev_ebitda","asset"]

#create dictionary from the symbol list
i=0
while i <len(symbol): 
    vars()[symbol[i]] = {}
    vars()[symbol[i]]['symbol']=symbol[i]
    vars()[symbol[i]]['ev_ebitda'] = 40
    vars()[symbol[i]]['asset'] = 60
    i +=1

#output csv
f = open('output.csv', 'wb')
w =csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames = header)
w.writeheader()
w.writerow(cvx)   
</code></pre>

 <p>I have a very basic understanding of how hormones affect  behavior. Especially for Ex: when it comes to sexuality and motivation, I learnt from some sources(friends ans interesting conversations) that things like the male sexuality is dominated by hormones which have a feeling similar to fighting and conquering. Similarly, the sex hormone of females motivates women to develop feelings similar to settling, and creating a nest for their young ones.</p>

<p>I was wondering if my understanding is correct, and if so, whether the sense of purpose in life, which we depend upon to make our life seem meaningful, is also related to the same hormone. I would also like to know whether the addiction to smoking, or for that matter porn is also related to human drive to find purpose in life by secreting a similar hormone and keeping us motivated. Thus, my question is to know more about the hormones and their effect on the way we feel about our life.</p>

<p>For people who want a one line question, What is the effect of hormones on the way we sense life?</p>

<p>It would be also good if someone could point me to some books or resources where I can explore this topic better and deeper</p>

</code></pre>

<p>using </p>

<pre><code>$brand= (string)$file->properties->property[1]->attributes()

<p>I got manufacturer data (name), but </p>

<pre><code>$brand= (string)$file->properties->property[1]->attributes()->value
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't works for getting Nike (value)</p>

<p>How could I get property[value] data?
Thanks in advance</p>

 <p>I have a webapp running in Tomcat7 which integrates with a 3rd party REST API with an oauth authentication.  The problem I am having is intermittent and seems to happen after the application has ran about a week or more.</p>

<p>When trying to request a token from the 3rd party API, I get the following response: 
Caused by: <strong>javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: Host name 'login.blah.com' does not match the certificate subject provided by the peer (CN=*.blacked.com, OU=Domain Control Validated).</strong></p>

<p>The thing is, if I do a curl from this same machine, it responds correctly and if I restart Tomcat, the error goes away.  I am using Spring and making the call using the RestTemplate class.</p>

<p>Originally I used the default implementation of RestTemplate and was receiving a pretty generic SocketTimeout exception.  I then switched i to use Apache HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory so I could make sure my HttpClient was closing and not leaving behind stale connections (since the issue only occurs after it's been running awhile).  Since switching to HttpClient 4.5, I've been getting the certificate issue.</p>

<p>I also have the webapp running in a test environment, hitting the same URL and working fine while the app in production is throwing the exception. Restarting tomcat fixes the issue.  The name in the exception message "CN=*.blacked.com" is not the domain I am attempting to hit and appears to be the domain of a porn website.</p>

<p>Now, every HTTP call I make to the 3rd party API, I create a new RestTemplate with a HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory, make my request, close the HttpClient and destroy the connection factory.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what could be causing this and can't really reproduce the error on demand since it's a very intermittent problem.  Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
