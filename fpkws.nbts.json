I am aware that my question is a bit long one and maybe I have not explained myself well enough but any comment or suggestion is appreciated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am trying to make a Cox PH model and predictions for roof repair on houses. I have 5 input variables (covariates):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHouse_Age (also called Start), House_Price, Roof_Material_Grp_New, Land_Ownership_Status_Grp, Living_Status_Grp\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the names suggest the first two are numeric variables and the last three at categorical. My problem is that I want to make the House_Age hazard to be depending on time. I chose to do 'datasplitting' for every third year of House_Age (so House_Age turns into the variable Start) - for instance in the case of an Event happening after 7 years the data would look like\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eStart Stop Event_01_Ts\n\n0    3           0 (Censored)\n3    3           0 (Censored)\n6    1           1 (Event)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStart is equal to the House_Age. As I could see on the estimates of each value of Start group there seemed to a linear dependence until about 40 years so I chose to have a maximum Start/House_Age of 40 and a linear relation\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCox_Mod_Lin \u003c- coxph(Surv(Stop,Event_01_Ts) ~ Start+Roof_Material_Grp_New+House_Contract_Yen+Land_Ownership_Status_Grp+Living_Status_Grp,data=Abt_Roof_Ts_Mdl)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe model comes out fine with linear coefficient on the Start variable on 0.1916 and an exponential value of 1.211\n                                  coef  exp(coef)   se(coef)       z Pr(\u003e|z|)\u003cbr\u003e\nStart                        1.916e-01  1.211e+00  6.817e-03  28.112  \u003c 2e-16 ***\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking on the Start/House_Age isolated, the hazard increases by 21% each year - is the correct? My problem is that now I want to make predicitons of 'repair' probabilities whitin 1, 5 and 10 years for instance. First I try to find the baseline hazard function by using survfit and a zero-vector as input\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eBase \u003c- survfit(Cox_Mod_Lin,Abt_Baseline,type='aalen')\nBase_Time_Hz \u003c- as.data.frame(cbind(Base$time,Base$cumhaz))\nBase_Time_Hz_1yr \u003c- Base_Time_Hz[which(Base_Time_Hz$Time==1),]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere Abt_Baseline contains zeroes for numerical variables and zero-level group values for groups. From this I find the cumulative hazard for time=1, 5 and 10 (only 1 year is shown) and multiply this with the exponential of the \"lp\" prediction found by using the predict function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne year prediction:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePred_01\u003c-Base_Time_Hz_1yr$Cumhaz*exp(predict(Cox_Mod_Lin,Abt_Roof_Score, type=\"lp\"))\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be OK if there were no time dependent inputs but the hazard varies in the future as a function of the Start (=House_Age) variable. I know the future values of the Start (increase by 1 each year) so I suppose that I could integrate somehow over the prediction period. So I have two main questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes this seem to be a sensible way for doing the modeling and (some of) the prediction?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf yes - how do I do the integration over the prediction period with with respect to the varying (increasing) House_Age/Start hazard? \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCan anybody help me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBest regards \nPeter\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//stackoverflow.com/questions/38453477","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2016-07-19T08:42:09.000Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T08:42:48.000Z","site_id":1,"user_link":"//stackoverflow.com/u/6344600","username":"Peter S","why":"Body - Position 282-293: roof repair","user_reputation":1,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":28493,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":34544,"title":"Big Data \u0026 Analytics","body":"\u003cp\u003eI am B.E graduate and \u0026 MBA student and currently working with Atos India Pvt Ltd as a project coordinator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was interested in moving ahead as Business Analyst by learning Big Data .Could someone help me ans the below 2 questions ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e**1.

In the case of flashlight without the box, the scales move a little due to the loss of mass. So far so good. Now, suppose you have the mirror box on the scales and break one wall. It is no longer a closed system, light is emitted and the scales should move. BUT, how do the scales know what I consider to be a closed system? Do they move at a time the light leaves the box through the crack in the wall? What if the box were just larger, would the weight loss happen later? Or, if I had a box full of cracks and sent a beam of light through it, would the scales indicate weight increase at a time the light enters the box? This seems totally wrong, but I can't see a difference, from the point of view of the scales, between a cracked box with beam of light going through it and a sealed box with a beam of light moving inside.

From the functional biology point of view, low libido is actually caused by imbalance of hormones. Stress suppresses rest-and-digest autonomous nervous system and activates fight-or-flight autonomous nervous system (that's why stress, depression etc damage health). In case of Captain America, yes, he got negative emotions after he was defrosted, but his super soldier serum should take care of his biological health. So, one of the other possibilities: He is gay (which has been proved to be a natural condition, not some kind of abnormality).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo prove that he is gay, let's look at his emotional responses: In 21st century, when he met Peggy, he didn't become emotional.

If I had met my first love in such situation, I would have become emotional and it'd actually hurt to know that she is old and I am young.

By no means, Captain America's emotional response looks straight man's response and it looks a gay's response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs Captain America really gay? Am I overthinking or producers are really hinting something to throw later? These days it's common in media for awareness.

Seven variables were \ncoded: \n1. Sex \n2. Total amount of television viewing hours over the previous week \n3. Height in metres \n4. Weight in kilograms \n5. BMI\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll continuous variables were initially analysed using exploratory data analysis \ntechniques to (a) check for data entry errors, and (b) test the assumptions of normality and \nhomogeneity of variance. Techniques included identifying data entry errors via visual \nSex Differences in the Relationship 5\u003cbr\u003e\ninspection of histograms, stem-and-leaf plots and normality plots; inferential tests for \nnormality, such as Levene’s test; and both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks \ntests for homogeneity of variance. \nAll continuous variables exhibited high levels of positive and negative skew, with p \n= .000 for all normality tests. A range of transformations were attempted, however, none \nresulted in any notable improvement in the distributions of scores, so the original data \nwere used for all subsequent analyses. Further, the homogeneity of variance assumption, \nusing sex as the nominal variable, was found to be violated at p \u003e .50 for all outcome \nmeasures. A reciprocal log-root transformation was applied to the sex variable, and \nsubsequent testing found that the assumption had been met. \nTable 1 presents the descriptive results for all variables. These results clearly \ndemonstrate strong and statistically significant sex differences in all measured variables: \nheight, weight, BMI and television viewing hours. Females had significantly higher \nBMI’s than males, and watched significantly more television, clearly supporting the \nhypothesis that being female is causally related to both a increased BMI and watching \nmore television. \nThe overall correlations, and the correlations for males and females separately are \nshown in Table 2. For the overall sample, there was a strong and significant positive \ncorrelation between both BMI and weight, and television viewing hours. For all \ncorrelations, the relationship between television viewing hours and the two weight \nmeasures, weight and BMI, was statistically significantly stronger for males than it was for females. These correlations were all assessed using 2 analysis, which allows causal \nconclusions to be reached. \nRegarding sex differences, a series of paired samples t-tests demonstrated significant \nsex differences for all variables: height, t(3.33) = 34.71, p = .002; weight, t(38) = 1.79, p \n= .081; television viewing hours, t(38) = 3.49, p = .069; and BMI, t(37.18) = 6.58, p = \n.52. Examination of the descriptive statistics in Table 1 indicates that, on average, males \nwere taller than females, whereas females were significantly heavier, had higher BMI’s \nSex Differences in the Relationship 6\u003cbr\u003e\nand watched more television. All of these t-tests were based on unequal variance due to \nviolation of the homogeneity of variance assumption.\u003cbr\u003e\nDiscussion \nThe hypothesis that there would be a strong and significant causal relationship \nbetween BMI, weight and television viewing hours was clearly supported. For the overall \nsample, as well as for the male and female participants separately, there were strong and \nsignificant correlations between the two weight-related measures and television viewing \nhours. This result accords with previous related research, and supports the long-held \nperception that television viewing, a passive form of entertainment for young adolescents, \nis related to a propensity to overweight. Most notably, however, given the nature of the \nresearch design, the present study is the first published investigation to demonstrate a \ncausal relationship between television viewing and overweight. This result has important \nscientific and clinical applications in the area of adolescent obesity and strongly suggests \nthat an intervention program that focuses on limiting, or even eliminating, television \nviewing, has a high probability of leading to substantial and permanent weight loss. \nFurther, there were clear sex differences in the nature of the relationship between \ntelevision viewing and BMI, with much stronger relationships evident for females. This \nresult clearly argues for targeted interventions toward adolescent females, as it is clear \nfrom the results of the present study that the excessive television viewing is a more potent \ncausal agent for obesity in females than males. This result also implies that females are \nengaging in less physical activity than males, an interpretation that is supported by the \nsignificantly higher level of television viewing hours for the female participants. \nFuture research might choose to focus on evaluating well-designed interventions for \nreducing television viewing hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//stats.stackexchange.com/questions/210129","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2016-04-30T07:11:17.000Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T07:23:45.000Z","site_id":17,"user_link":"//stats.stackexchange.com/u/114037","username":"Jamanuel","why":"Body - Position 4098-4109: weight loss","user_reputation":1,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":21414,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":26729,"title":"Im wondering how to calculate winstrols half life?","body":"\u003cp\u003eThe reason i ask is because a horse i have had winstrol in its system when tested in serum.

However, the machine can also return a missing score in some circumstances (missing score=1). The hypothesis is that the proportion of missing scores might be influenced by the heterozygosis of the sample (which is system specific: i.e. it may vary within sample across sessions, which test different antigen systems). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am assuming that replicates (my lowest level observations) are nested within the combination of sessions and blood samples (i.e. replicates are cross-classified within sessions by samples), which I consider as random effects. I am also interpreting the antigen specific-asset of the sample tested as a fixed effect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have been implementing (Stata 13.1) a logistic mixed model (see also \u003ca href=\"http://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1337275-logistic-mixed-model-for-experimental-design-with-replicates\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elink\u003c/a\u003e to Statalist). The outcome is whether the score is missing or not for each observation in the dataset. I specify the sample antigen-specific asset as a fixed effect at level one (comparing heterozygosis vs homozygosis), and samples cross-classified with sessions as random effects at level 2. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWould anyone kindly suggest whether I am interpreting and modeling this experimental design correctly?

Like how long does it take for erosion to take place? I read somewhere salts and I think acids could erode it, but I have to check about that. Should I be concerned of amount of aluminum that could be reabsorbed into my skin over several years typing on the keyboard?

I travelled as a tourist to Singapore several times, never overstayed, but I did usually stay nearly the maximum 90 days.  I have OCD and wash everything.  One time I got rejected when I tried to enter Singapore with a damp passport because I was told it was not in good condition.  I know that sounds stupid to present a damp passport but it gets worse ... also I got quite upset because I was being deported all the way back to USA and I did not want to go back.  It was a business class ticket on Singapore airlines and the airline was responsible to pay for my return so they did not like that and subsequently banned me.  I did get accepted back into Singapore as a tourist a year or so later, but had a few weird problems like getting caught for taking a shower at a resort swimming pool facility where I did not stay.  I had to leave Singapore in an odd way, with my passport held at the airport.  I had to collect it with a special letter on the day of my flight.  I tried to go back again to Singapore about a year after with a good quality passport but was refused for \"secret reasons\".  The officer did mention to not try again for at least 6 months.\u003cbr\u003e\nI love Singapore because it is tropical and clean.

I did to try troubleshoot but that failed which I did not expect to work anyways.\nThe interesting thing was on my old laptop it wouldn't allow to charge my IOS and yet we have here the similar problem which does have wifi at the very beginning I believe at least sometimes and then it disconnects and goes. I was inside change network adapter and there the \"Wifi\" dissapeard today again.\nOn the Ethernet it says there would be a Network cable unplugged but i do not have a ealtek PCle GBE family controller.\nI do have a virtualbox but that has eighter way too no internet. The actual reason why I deleted the Virtual phone generators (bluestacks and so on) is because they suddenly stopped working. I really do not know anymore what to do. I really need help I believe my laptop will die soon and end in a boot loop like my other one did. It by the way didn't work even before i had avira.\nPlease help me i need really help.\nThank you very much indeed for taking your time reading this\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//superuser.com/questions/1047794","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2016-03-02T17:51:31.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T17:51:59.000Z","site_id":3,"user_link":"//superuser.com/u/565970","username":"Gaby taylor","why":"Body - Position 1155-1164: Spyhunter","user_reputation":1,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":15146,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":19685,"title":"Google Vision API: Using google vision API can we detect that ID is fake?","body":"\u003cp\u003eI want to use this API for my application, which can detect the \"fake ID\" and \"fake Passports\".

As you can see in the image below (iFrame element and jScript name), I am getting these frequent pop-ups which keep bothering me every time I open a website. As always, the minute I try to close them (a close button appears when I hover my mouse over it), it opens up a new tab and takes me to suspicious websites. The \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eone url\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that always appears before being redirected to a random malicious page is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edouble-u double-u double-u dot tradeadexchange dot com\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hCvM6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiFrame Element and jScript\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I resorted to taking SU's help and \u003ca href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/100360/how-can-i-remove-malicious-spyware-malware-adware-viruses-trojans-or-rootkit\"\u003ereading Joel Coehoorn's answer here\u003c/a\u003e, I had scanned my employer-provided laptop with SpyHunter (free license) and Kaspersky Rootkit Removal Tool. I can't blindly follow Joel's suggested solutions without an unambiguous confirmation of the infection because I would have to submit it to my employer's lazy, good-for-nothing maintenance team who will assuredly take 2 weeks to do it while cutting corners and not being as thorough as Joel Coehoorn suggested. And during which I, a developer working in the IT dept, would be forced to use a substitute ancient with performance slower than Win98 on 64kb ROM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKaspersky Rootkit Removal tool found nothing whatsoever. On my personal laptop, I use a licensed copy of Kaspersky Internet Security, and it blocks these ads and shows me a \u003cem\u003eMalicious URL blocked\u003c/em\u003e message every time I open a website. SpyHunter gave me the location of 3 cookie files that it identified as malware/spyware, which I promptly deleted. And, not so surprisingly, they keep popping up every now and then. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think the SpyHunter results are false-positives. Why? Because - and this is a curve-ball for me - I am getting these same pop-ups on other devices that \u003cem\u003euse my \u003cstrong\u003ehome\u003c/strong\u003e WiFi connection\u003c/em\u003e too, but which have \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003enever, ever, ever\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e had a data-transfer with my laptop. Also, a friend of mine gets his internet connection from the same ISP, and he too is getting similar pop-ups. Now again, this does not rule out malware, his system too could have been compromised. Another important point, \u003cstrong\u003eI don't get these ads when I connect to my office's WiFi connection\u003c/strong\u003e. The office connection obviously has a host of professional firewalls and security measures implemented, but, and again, I don't think those measures are the reasons why I don't get the pop-ups on the office WiFi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I would be very, very, very thankful if the community could help me out on this. I just need a concrete confirmation as to whether my system indeed is compromised or if it's my home router or the ISP itself. Also, is it possible that an infected system, when connected to an entirely new network, transmit sufficient details so as to compromise all systems on that network too, without the other systems doing anything whatsoever? Deep down I know this is possible, but not sure.

They seemed to be stuck in an other planet and settled on some one floor futuristic base, which was attacked by aliens or robots maybe.\nThe thing is it has lots of female nudity (breasts and full frontal) and some sex scenes, girls were pretty hot.

Our 8 year old son is refusing to learn how to offer namaz and does not offer prayers either, and in his school, he has been slapped and beaten by teachers for questioning the righteousness of God. (In my country, which is Pakistan, it is common for boys to be beaten to motivate them to learn, this happens in every school with the exclusion of international ones, which are extremely expensive.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, he came back home with half of his face completely red. When I asked him what happened, he told me that his teacher slapped him hard for asking \"Why is God so hungry for praise?\" and although this doesn't sound too much cruel in English, in Urdu, it was said in a very harsh and informal manner, which was \"Khuda itna bhuka kiyun hai tarifen or namaz key liye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this isn't the only time he did something like this with God. Some time earlier, we had the following conversation;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHim: \"Mom, Molvi (a scholar) was telling me that in the Quran, it is said that God has already written every second of our lives down, he has decided everything already he said. Is this true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMe: \"Ofcourse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHim: \"So when everyday, people are killed on the streets like they say on the news, and when those bombings happened some time ago here, lots of people died. And since God decides every second of our lives, did he decide the killers to go and kill them? That God himself is the killer and not us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy husband very quickly shouted at him and told him not to say things like this ever again, but he does it again and again whenever the topic of religion is touched. He is very curious, but sometimes, he gets too curious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I must also mention that once with my husband, he was asking who wrote the Quran, and my husband replied that it was God, then he asked did somebody see him doing it, that is there a video of it, my husband replied no ofcourse, then he said how do we know that God was written the Quran?, to which my husband replied that it was given to Prophet Muhammad by an angel, and then he asked whether there was a video or anything of it, and my husband replied no, and then he said \"Dad, so how do know that there really is God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must also add here that he does not have the Internet, and we have never let him use the computer. Everyday, he comes back home and reads the mathematical and scientific books like Principia, Conics, Elements, Posterior Analytics..etc which my husband has (which are many). And my husband told me that nowhere in these books something against God is written and infact, many of these books actually speak of God reverently. (since they are old)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe keeps doing these things often, and I am afraid that one day, he will get us in a very bad situation. I do not want the scholar at school or anybody to say that we should kill him, which is becoming more and more possible. (\u003cstrong\u003eIn Pakistan, there is a law set by the government that anybody, of any age, will be hanged for speaking vilely against God.\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I cannot ask anybody for help in this case, the answer will very surely be \"Beat the blashempy out of him!\". And I do not want that. Is there a way I can make my son realize that there is a God, or if not, then how can I teach my son not to say things like these infront of anybody ever again and just listen? (We have already tried telling him nicely, but he never acts accordingly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/23136","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-11-23T19:20:42.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T22:33:34.000Z","site_id":90,"user_link":"//parenting.stackexchange.com/users/19943/sanaahmed","username":"SanaAhmed","why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":5474,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":9158,"title":"Border alignment on html website out of alignment","body":"\u003cp\u003eI have a simple one page html website which has a border around it, and I waqs editing the html, and I must have made a mistake with something, because now the border is all out of alignment. the website is \u003ca href=\"http://weightlosssuccess.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://weightlosssuccess.xyz\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would post the html code, but I think it would go over the character limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//stackoverflow.com/questions/33862857","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-11-23T02:29:14.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T22:28:46.000Z","site_id":1,"user_link":"//stackoverflow.com/users/5584176/aaron-marston","username":"Aaron Marston","why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":5400,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":9139,"title":"unable to define regular expression for re.compile and pass it to Beautifulsoup","body":"\u003cp\u003ecurrently m practicing on the basic concept of accessing web using python. i am following a tutorial on youtube and was guided till the following code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003efrom urllib2 import urlopen,  HTTPError\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\n\nurl=\"http://getbusinessreviews.org/\"\ntry:\n   webpage = urlopen(url).read\nexcept HTTPError, e:  \n    if e.code == 404:\n        e.msg = 'data not found on remote: %s' % e.msg\n    raise\npathFinderTitle = re.compile('\u003ch2 class=\"entry-title\"\u003e\u003ca href.* rel=\"bookmark\"\u003e(.*)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e')\nif  webpage:\n    if pathFinderTitle:\n        findPathTitle = re.findall(pathFinderTitle,webpage)\n    else:\n        print \"unable to get path finder title\"\n\nelse:\n    print \"unable to url open \"\nlistIterator =[]\nlistIterator[:]= range(2,10)\n\nfor i in listIterator:\n    print findPathTitle[i]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ei want to extract \"Nutracoster\" from the following HTML\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e        \u003ch2 class=\"entry-title\"\u003e\n\n            \u003ca href=\"http://getbusinessreviews.org/nutracoster/\" rel=\"bookmark\"\u003eNutracoster\u003c/a\u003e\n\n        \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI've got three questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am getting no results at the moment can any one guide me what i am going wrong?(I guess my regular expression is not well defined)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can i pass this Re to Beautifulsoup ?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there a generic method to iterate till last value, instead of giving value 10 in \"listIterator[:]= range(2,10)\" since i am having outOfBound Error if the tags are less than 10\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance and sorry for any silly mistakes since i am at learning stage :D\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//stackoverflow.com/questions/33855542","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-11-22T13:56:53.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T16:52:30.000Z","site_id":1,"user_link":"//stackoverflow.com/users/841029/nightgale","username":"NightGale","why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":5387,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":9077,"title":"Math entrance sample exam questions that I need to learn","body":"\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a store, the revenue in February is 2/5 the revenue in March.

Don't get me wrong. I love the job. it taught me a lot of things. I love the people there and my boss. But I had a very uncomfortable situation with some customers that did not sit well with me. They were sort of harassing me. At one point, One of them said they watched asian porn that had someone look like me. It made me feel very very uncomfortable. I thought it was whatever wouldn't have to deal with the customer ever again. But i noticed a lot of these customers staring at my chest even when i'm wearing a baggy shirt.  One actually sniffed me and said i smelt good and gave me a creepy look. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI stared to feel increasingly uncomfortable going to work. And another contribute to as why I feel like i might want to quit is that, the smell from the restaurant next doors gives me a really really bad head ache. Every time i get off work. It makes me feel sickly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo my question is, Is it wrong for me to quit the job on those standards? I've only worked for a month. But that incident with the male customer hasn't left my mind and I don't know how to bring it up with my employer. I feel bad if I quit because the company spent time with me to train me and teach me all these new things and they would have to hire someone new since they are short on staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/58067","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-11-20T07:42:48.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T16:52:28.000Z","site_id":156,"user_link":"//workplace.stackexchange.com/users/44208/user44208","username":"user44208","why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":5249,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":8876,"title":"MySQL Sum-up values and insert them into table","body":"\u003cp\u003eI have this Database:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTable Name: Single Database: Produkt\nID  PID     BID            ListingID    Brand   PN     Model\n1   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Nike    P14    505\n1   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Nike    P14    715\n1   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Puma    P14    L14\n1   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Puma    P14    P15\n2   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Samsung XL14XL 505\n2   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Samsung XL14XL 715\n2   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Samsung XL14XL L14\n2   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   Samsung XL14XL P14\n3   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    503\n3   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    503\n3   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    703\n3   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    713\n4   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    715\n4   1234    XXXXXXXX    1234-XXXXXXXX   EPSON   P14    503\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd i want to sum up the \"Model\" in the lines Where \"ID-Brand-PN\" is the same\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how i want my new Table to look:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTable Name: master Database: Produkt\nID  Brand   PN      AModel\n1   Nike    P14     505, 715\n1   Puma    P14     L14, P15\n2   Samsung XL14XL  505, 715, L14, P14\n3   EPSON   P14     503, 703, 713\n4   EPSON   P14     715, 503\n\n\n\nPseudo-Code:\nSingle Row = 1\n\nfor each Single Row= NOT NULL{\nIF Single Row ID and Brand and PN and Model = Exist\n{\nInsert into AModel Row where it exists \", Model\"  \n}\nELSE \n{\nWrite Single ID and Brand and PN and Model into Master\nSingle Row + 1}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for your time and effort, if you need more Details i´ll provide them, I don´t mind writing a php Script when i can make a trigger that which starts the Script when a new row is added to single\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//stackoverflow.com/questions/33800096","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-11-19T09:40:33.000Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T16:52:27.000Z","site_id":1,"user_link":"//stackoverflow.com/users/5246589/finua","username":"finua","why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":5078,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":8810,"title":"IS it possible to show category icons instead of a thumbnail in the product page?","body":"\u003cp\u003eI am using woocommerce and I would like to instead of using the product image thumbnail always use the images of the category the product belongs to.\nThis is the page I am building.

The way your main house panel is you can come back off the subpanel nutrals with a extra wire to all your grounds in garage or shed. You need to learn the old way was just as good as the new way.l just dont ground the box and yes it does work. And yes the inspector does not mess with me any more im hard headed. And his oulet is wrong the ground and nutral should be in box and seperate wires should go to outlet. The new thing today is they have a crazy made up idea that a seperate ground is safer for lightning bullshit all most all of the old houses are still standing or fell down from old age. When lighting strikes a main service it will go right back to ground rod. Not come back up the nutrals.

Actuators receive \"settings\" of values at specific times (e.g., setting the rotating speed of a pump to 2000 RPM). Sensors can collect “readings\", sets of values at specific times. For instance, a device for measuring the heart rate could send the last 60 values sampled in the past hour to be stored on the database associated to the time of collecting that data from the sensor; in that case, an example reading would store the signal as 60 name-value pairs (“minute 00” : 75, “minute 01” : 78, … “minute 59” : 125) associated to \"Wed Sep 30 23:58:29 WEST 2015”.

If not please point me in a better direction.  I'm working on a project that requires a counterweight in a tight/organic space.

Maybe the only risk is during the encapsulation process?

But I'm still left with an unproven theory that others here might help confirm or reject. Being that, when faced with being placed onto a targeted location, the solder--after assuming a spherical shape--would, at times, refuse to separate from the iron's tip or, more often, flee the area, rolling the length of the workspace, around obstacles, up walls, or--I imagine--down entire city blocks until I would decide to break off the chase and simply create a whole new obstinate silvery blob, could it be that I had inadvertently magnetized the soldering tip by storing it next to a battery or some other atmospheric anomaly and thereby causing it to disrupt the normal soldering process and ultimately revealing it to be the cause of my circuitrous disability?

I also currently work full time as a mental health case manager in a local organization and am married. \nOver the last two semesters (and summer semester was 4 intense weeks of three classes), I have now obtained a C and will have to repeat the summer course to be able to obtain licensure in Ohio. So, this is one course to add on to the end so I can get licensure later. Because of the intensive counseling work we are already doing in addition to starting my practicum next semester, I feel like I am falling behind. I want to be getting A's- or at least B's- and I doing just well enough to pass. I'm about halfway through the semester and already looking at two 85's or lower right now. \nI have a plan, but how do i get back on track? I want to start next semester with a good start, even if it is part-time, and do not want to have to repeat any courses from this semester. I am currently in diagnosis, at-risk populations, and techniques in addition to working full-time, maintaining a marriage, social life, and attempting to lose weight. \nI have so much on my plate, making attempts to organize it, and just have no idea how i will get it all done. \nI cannot leave my job! I also recently got over a bout of a depressive episode and stopped seeing my therapist who i saw for two sessions- i chose to stop seeing her for a reason. \nPlease, any suggestions would be appreciated. Any suggestions for my writing, or clarifications, would be helpful. I am happy to send any of my writing for your critique.

Then there was Sport Aid, Farm Aid and Net Aid. And now, 20 years after Sir Bob Geldof and a bunch of big-haired pop stars urged us to \"Feed the World\", there is a music album released by Manager Aid. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe managers in question hail from John Lewis, the privately run British retailer. The worthwhile cause in question is Whizz Kidz, a charity dedicated to helping \"non-mobile children\". And the record in question is entitled New Shop On the Block. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes for harrowing listening. Not because two of the 10 tracks are about disabled children.

Answer: they were given the task of composing, arranging, producing and recording the LP as part of a team-building exercise, the aim of which was to bond them in a \"powerful collective experience\". \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI received my copy of New Shop On the Block while strolling around the World of Learning gathering at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, \"the UK's key conference and exhibition for business learning\". As he gave me the CD, the man from the training company that organised this \"Face the Music\" exercise for John Lewis remarked that the task had \"created one of the most highly bonded teams\" he had ever come across. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, he said, a brilliant way for them to commemorate the £100m revamp of their Peter Jones department store on London's Sloane Square. It was also \"very deep\" in terms of the changes it made in them. \"The MD involved in the project was crying by the end,\" he explained. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of hours later, when I played the CD for the first time, I understood exactly what he meant. The record made me want to weep too. And it wasn't just the awfulness of the music that upset me. It was also the fact that \"Face the Music\" marked a worrying trend in team-building exercises. Before I explain, some context. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time, team-building exercises didn't exist. People just came to work and bonded by \"working and getting along with each other\". Sometimes they would \"go for a drink after work\", \"play football on Saturday\" or \"go for dinner at the weekend\". But, generally speaking, team-building was a casual, natural, informal thing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in the 1980s, the business world decided that the only way of establishing a rapport between colleagues was by getting them to do group activities together - preferably on weekends, preferably outdoors and preferably in the rain. Sometimes referred to as \"experiential learning\", the idea was that workers would become immersed in an activity, learn new skills together and become closer-knit as a result. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA search through the cuttings shows that, over time, businesses have asked employees to participate in every group activity under the sun in the name of team-building: paintballing, mountain climbing, Porsche racing, sailing, kendo, horse whispering, clowning, treasure hunting, potholing, go-karting, cookery, international folk dancing, chicken herding, belly dancing, totem pole carving, wine blending - and, my own favourite, motorised toilet-bowl racing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJudging from what I saw at the NEC, such exercises are as popular as ever: exhibitors were offering team-building courses in everything from yachting to truffle-hunting. When I saw a sign for the \"Adult Learning Inspectorate\", I thought, for a brief but horrible moment, that even the porn industry was getting in on the act. (Incredibly, I have since discovered that this has actually happened: Hustler TV, a digital channel, is encouraging companies to make porn films as a team-building exercise.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile such exercises are generally useless, as most take place behind closed doors or in the middle of nowhere, they are also mostly harmless (although a few do go disastrously wrong: who can forget the story of staff at Eagle Star life insurance who were sufficiently motivated by a day-long fire-walking course that they agreed to walk barefoot over hot coals and ended up in hospital as a result? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, exercises such as \"Face the Music\" and \"Curtain Up!\" - another team-building exercise offered by the same training company, in which colleagues perform in front of a live crowd - represent something new and ominous. Unlike paintballing and motorised toilet bowl racing, these \"multi-sensory experiences\", as they are described, require an audience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if there is one thing more excruciating than being involved in a team-building exercise, it is watching or enduring someone else's team-building exercise. I speak from experience, having listened to New Shop On the Block three times. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Lewis may defend the release of its atrocious album by saying it will raise money for a good cause. And the charity element is certainly a mitigating factor. But I suspect that the people who have heard it would give even more generously if their donations meant they would never have to listen to New Shop on the Block ever again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do not own this article, all rights reserved by the FT\u003c/p\u003e\n","link":"//english.stackexchange.com/questions/274967","post_creation_date":null,"created_at":"2015-09-20T06:51:49.000Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T22:13:30.000Z","site_id":33,"user_link":null,"username":null,"why":null,"user_reputation":null,"score":null,"upvote_count":null,"downvote_count":null,"stack_exchange_user_id":null,"is_tp":false,"is_fp":true},{"id":3149,"title":"Binding Android Retrofit Multipart Data to Play Framework","body":"\u003cp\u003eI have been trying to bind my android multiform data to the play framework form binding.
